Remember *[McLaren v Caldwell](../week8/#Water%20Rights%20and%20Expropriation)*, the case about riparian rights in "non-navigable" steams that were crucial to the lumber industry in Northern Ontario?  

 **Refresh your memory:** Justice Ritchie (SCC) expressed a key principle of statutory interpretation in *McLaren v Caldwell*, which he used to resolve the issue of constructive expropriation.  

- What is this principle (check out paragraph 16 of Ritchie's judgement)?

- In what way was this principle a product of the classical style?

- How did Justice Ritchie use this principle to resolve the case?

- Could we use this principle to resolve the issue of *de facto* expropriation in the Blue Mountain-Birch Cove problem?

Next, we'll compare this classical approach to one that employs the modern style of common law thought.

**Develop the theme:** the excerpt below from Oliver Wendell Holmes' *Path of Law* lays the conceptual foundation for the modern style. 

- How does Holmes' general approach depart from the classical one?

- How would Homes answer the *[Three Questions of Common Law Style](../week4/#three-questions-of-common-law-style)*?
