We will take a pause this week to revisit, review and synthesize the material we've covered so far in Unit 3. The goal is to help you gain a firmer grasp on the core themes, doctrines and applications from this unit as you head into reading week and perhaps start to plan your studying for final exams.

To prepare you for class this week, I have drafted a number of targeted review questions that emphasize key concepts and issues we have studied in Unit 3. Please work through these questions and bring your answers—along with your own questions about the material—to class for discussions. There are no additional readings for you to complete this week.
