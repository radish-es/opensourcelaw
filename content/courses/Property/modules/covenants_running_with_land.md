Restrictive covenants belong to a legal category called *servitudes*--incidents of property that shape or limit an owner's "bundle of rights" in land. 

**"I promise...":** Restrictive covenants look like a promise by one landowner to their neighbour(s) not to do something on their own land. 

- For example, I might promise not to play loud music after 10PM to avoid annoying my neighbours, even if my property rights and other applicable rules would otherwise allow this use.

 - But here's the wrinkle: I don't need to create a special property right to accomplish this. My neighbours and I could simply make a binding contract. They pay me some amount of money and I agree to forego the late night parties.

What, then, does a restrictive covenant achieve, and how is it different from a contractual promise? 

*Tulk v Moxhay*, below, helps to answer this question. It involves what looks like a contractual promise between neighbouring landowners.

- Normally, any new owner of the park in the case (Leicester Square) would not be captured by privity of contract, making the terms of that contact unenforceable against them.

- And yet, the Court is willing to hold the new owner to the terms of the original bargain as a matter of property. ***Why?***
