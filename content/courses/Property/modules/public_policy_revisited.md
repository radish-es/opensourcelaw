title: Public Policy Revisited
short: Public Policy
---


At the end of Week 15, we discussed the Supreme Court's resistance in *Noble and Wolf v Alley* to apply the public policy doctrine to invalidate a discriminatory restrictive covenant. Despite Justice Mackay's robust engagement with this doctrine in *Re Drummond Wren*, it would not receive sustained attention by the Canadian courts until more than three decades later. The Ontario Court of Appeal returned to the challenge of applying the public policy doctrine to "private" property arrangements in *Canada Trust Co v Ontario (Human Rights Commission)*, in the context of a testamentary bequest via a charitable trust.

As you read these cases, consider how the courts describe and apply the public policy doctrine. Has the doctrine changed since *Re Drummond Wren*? Would it be possible, based on these cases, to successfully argue that the testamentary bequest in our problem this week should be found invalid on the basis of public policy? What are the key differences and similarities between the interests here and those at issue in *Canada Trust Co* and in *McCorkill*?
