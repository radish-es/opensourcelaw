title: Section 7 and the Right to Shelter
short: Section 7 Right to Shelter
---




Canada's *Charter of Rights and Freedoms* contains no freestanding constitutional right to housing or other forms of shelter. But in considering what protections the *Charter* affords to unhoused persons seeking access to public spaces to meet their immediate shelter and other basic needs, Canadian courts have developed certain limited protections under section 7 of the *Charter*, which reads:

> 7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.

In our course, we will not undertake a comprehensive analysis of section 7 rights, but instead focus on a few specific features of an emerging right to shelter in the context of access to public property. This topic has a great deal to teach us about the development and implications of the modern legal style.
