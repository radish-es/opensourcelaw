A McNeil points out in his historical study of the *St. Catherine's Milling* case, one of the most glaring aspects at every level of court is the lack of reliance on any evidence from Indigenous peoples regarding *their* interpretation of Indigenous land rights before and after Treaty 3 was signed. 

This absence was not merely from lack of historical or contemporary evidence. McNeil cites the following quote attributed to Chief Ma-we-do-pe-nais on the third day of negotiations around Treaty 3, included in Alexander Morris' book on the Numbered Treaties: [^mcneil2019c]

> All this is our property where you have come ... This is what we think, that the Great Spirit has planted us on this ground where we are, as you were where you came from. We think where we are is our property. I will tell you what he said to us when he planted us here; the rules that we should follow – us Indians – He has given us rules that we should follow to govern us rightly.

The absence of Indigenous voices and evidence in *St. Catherine's Milling* was not mere oversight. The inability and unwillingness to acknowledge these perspectives and what they could have told the courts about the relevance of Indigenous peoples' own laws is grounded in an underlying assumption that is only hinted at but never explicitly acknowledged by the judges: the assumption that the British Crown had legitimately asserted sovereignty over Indigenous territories in North America and therefore had an "underlying interest" to begin with. 

This assumption is premised on the so-called international law doctrine of discovery, which was used by European colonial powers to confiscate Indigenous peoples' lands and "destabilized their decision-making powers."[^borrows215] The doctrine of discovery was in turn constructed on the legal fiction of *terra nullius*—the fiction that Indigenous peoples had no established legal systems of their own prior to colonization. If Indigenous peoples had no laws, the land was "legally vacant" and therefore open to discovery and settlement. Such obviously false premises were supported and justified by the cultural inferiority ascribed to Indigenous peoples and so clearly expressed in Chancellor Boyd's decision above.

Next week, we turn more fully to this question of sovereignty and Indigenous legal orders by exploring the Peace and Friendship Treaties in Mi'kma'ki and aspects of Mi'kmaw law and land tenure.
