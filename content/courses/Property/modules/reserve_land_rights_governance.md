### Review: Three Themes of Colonialism

Some of the readings for this week dig deeply into the details of federal legislation governing reserve lands and into the common law doctrine of Aboriginal Title. While learning these details, we want to be careful not to lose sight of the colonial foundations and assumptions on which these laws are based. Take a moment to review the *[Three Themes of Colonialism in Law](../week1/#three-themes-of-colonialism-in-law)* from Week 1 of the course and work to identify their influence as you study the material below.
