Professors Val Napoleon and Emily Snyder have recently published a study of housing on reserve and the role of Indigenous property laws in four Indigenous communities in northwestern British Columbia. As Napoleon and Snyder describe in the introduction to that study:[^napoleon2020]

> Paul Nadasdy has observed that in the negotiation of their land claim agreement, the Kluane First Nation in the Yukon "translate their complex reciprocal relationship with the land into an equally complex but very different language of ‘property.’" According to Indigenous political science scholar Glen Coulthard, the negotiation of land rights has reoriented "Indigenous struggle from one that was once deeply informed by the land as a system of reciprocal relations and obligations … to a struggle that is now largely for land, understood here as some material resource to be exploited in the capital-accumulation process." While Coulthard is not addressing reserve land, the questions concerning relationships to land, economies, and governance, along with competing legal orders, are the not-so-deep undercurrents beneath the property-on-reserve debate. This larger political frame is usually ignored and replaced with debates about Indigenous property on reserve land that mainly start and remain inside unquestioned Western property constructs and ongoing colonial structures.

While the authors of this study are careful to contextualize their findings in relation to the specific legal orders of the Tsimshian and Carrier (*Dakelh*) nations, they also work to extrapolate broader lessons and questions concerning the development and application of Indigenous laws in other settings of on-reserve housing. Consider the critical questions raised in the concluding section of this article as you return to our case study for this week.
