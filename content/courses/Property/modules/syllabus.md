title: Read the Syllabus
short: Syllabus

Before you start to explore the course materials, please familiarize yourself with the procedures and expectations for our course this year. Start by reading the [Course Syllabus]({{< ref "/courses/property/admin/syllabus" >}}) and reviewing the [Course Schedule]({{< ref "/courses/property/admin/schedule" >}}). These are the main documents you'll need to use throughout the year to understand the course logistics, expectations, policies and schedule for assigned readings and class meetings.

Aim to begin this week with a good understanding of:

- [Course procedures]({{< ref "/courses/property/admin/syllabus#general-information" >}}) for communicating with me and arranging appointments outside of class meetings;

- How to access the [course website and assigned materials;]({{< ref "/courses/property/admin/syllabus#course-website-and-course-materials" >}})

- [Goals and expectations]({{< ref "/courses/property/admin/syllabus#course-goals-and-expectations" >}}) for class preparation and participation in class meetings;

- How you will be [evaluated]({{< ref "/courses/property/admin/syllabus#evaluation" >}}) in the course; and

- Your rights and responsibilities related to [accessibility and accommodations]({{< ref "courses/property/admin/syllabus#accessibility-and-accommodations" >}}).

I will highlight some key points from these materials at the beginning of this week's class meeting and will make time for your questions about the syllabus. If questions arise as you read the syllabus for the first time, you can submit them to me (anonymously) ahead of time using the form below.
