title: A Note on Abandonment
short: Abandonment
---

Just as it is possible to acquire property by first possession, property rights can also be "given up" through a processes called *abandonment*. In *Clift*, Chief Justice Hoyles explains the principle through the following quote:

> Property both in lands and moveables being thus originally acquired by the first taker it remains in him by the principles of universal law, till such time *as he does some other act which shows an intention to abandon it*, for then it becomes *publici juris* once more. So if one is possessed of a jewel and casts it into the sea, or a highway, this is such an express dereliction that the property will be vested in the first finder—not so if he hides it and it is discovered, there the finder acquires no property, and if *he loses* or drops it by accident, it cannot be collected from thence, that he designed to quit the possession, and, therefore, in such a case, *the property still remains in the loser, who may claim it against of the finder.*

In other words, abandonment occurs when property--once established by possession or other legal means--is voluntarily given up by the owner. As the quoted passage above notes, abandonment requires the owner to demonstrate an express *intention* to permanently abandon their property rights: they must have “the intention of terminating ownership, possession and control.”[^manning2008]

For example, in the 2008 case *Manning v Algard*, the defendant Algard lost or misplaced a briefcase containing 17th century gold coins. Those coins were later sold to Manning in a garage sale. Since Algard lost or misplaced his briefcase rather than intentionally leaving it behind, the court found that he had not abandoned the coins, and therefore concluded that Algard’s estate still owned them. 

However, as Chief Justice Hoyles also explains, there is a different rule with respect to wild animals (animals *ferae naturae*). Property in these animals can be established through first possession, but that property is *lost* again as soon as the animal escapes its owner's control. In this way, possessory rights in wild animals establish only a contingent form of property--unlike property in inanimate objects, which remain intact even if an object is lost or misplaced and insofar as it is not intentionally abandoned.
