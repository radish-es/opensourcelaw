Widespread industrialization came somewhat late in Canada compared to England and the United States, where nuisance law was addressed by courts as a potential impediment to economic "progress". As Jennifer Nedelsky explains:[^nedelsky1981]

> By the late nineteenth century, industrialization and urbanization were changing the shape of Canadian society: between 1880 and 1920 the population doubled from 3,689,257 to 8,788,483; 74.35 per cent of the population were classified as rural by the census of Canada in 1881; by 1921 the percentage had decreased to 50.48. Capital investment in manufactures increased from $165,302,632 in 1880 to $2,923,667,011 in 1920 and the gross value of all manufactured products from $469,847,886 in 1880 to $3,706,544,997 in 1920. Manufacturing, once diffused, was concentrating in industrial towns. Factories increasingly replaced small workshops, and steam-powered engines brought noise as well as productivity. As the nuisances of industrialization increased, so did the costs of eliminating them. Manufacturing establishments, for example, were becoming sufficiently large and important to local economies that ordering them to take their nuisances elsewhere would have had serious consequences.

Like their English and American counterparts before them, common law courts in Canada struggled to adjudicate nuisance claims in this evolving context, which often pitted the demands of business and the growing influence of industry against the traditional property rights of neighbouring landowners. However, because industrialization came relatively late to Canada, Canadian courts confronted nuisance cases against the background of legal principles already developed elsewhere. A key question became whether Canadian courts would follow these established precedents—primarily from England—or chart their own path tailored to the Canadian context.

The legal question of what remedy the Canadian courts should apply in cases where a nuisance had already been proven by the plaintiff was a key point of conflict between industrialists and their neighbours. The English Court of Appeal's decision in *Shelfer v City of London Electrical Lighting Co.* loomed large here. Traditionally, the common law afforded heavy priority to the absolute protection of private owners rights to use and enjoy their property, enforced by way of an injunction against the offending activities of neighbouring landowners. Industrialization brought increasing pressure on judges to soften this traditional bias in favour of injunctions and to allow for an award of damages in some cases. In *Shelfer*, the Court introduced a legal test that would give judges a workable guide to determining when damages were appropriate in lieu of an injunction. 

The brief excerpt below from *Shelfer* reviews this legal test on remedy in nuisance. To what extent does the *Shelfer* test help to clarify when a landowner's right to exclude should be enforced versus when a court should sanction a paid-for infringement of that right by awarding damages?
