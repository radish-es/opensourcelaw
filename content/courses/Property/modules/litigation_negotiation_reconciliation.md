title: 'Litigation, Negotiation, and Reconciliation'
short: Litigation

In concluding our study of the common law doctrine of Aboriginal title, it is useful to step back for a moment to place the instances of litigation we have explored into a broader context. As we discussed at length in Week 7, litigation to "prove" Aboriginal title comes with many legal and other risks and challenges for Indigenous nations, and is not the only—or necessarily the best—route toward recognizing and affirming Indigenous land rights and legal authorities. 

As you reflect on this question, consider two statements by judges deeply involved in Aboriginal title litigation. The first is by Chief Justice Lamer in *Delgamuukw*, having decided that the claim in that case could not proceed on procedural grounds: 

> [T]his litigation has been both long and expensive, not only in economic but in human terms as well. By ordering a new trial, I do not necessarily encourage the parties to proceed to litigation and to settle their dispute through the courts.

The second is by Justice Vickers, the trial judge in *Tsilhqot'in Nation*, who made the following observation at the end of a lengthy decision affirming the Tsilhqot'in Nation's claim:

> In an ideal world, the process of reconciliation would take place outside the adversarial milieu of a courtroom. This case demonstrates how the Court, confined by the issues raised in the pleadings and the jurisprudence on Aboriginal rights and title, is ill equipped to effect a reconciliation of competing interests ... Despite this fact, the question remains: how can this Court participate in the process of reconciliation between [Indigenous] people[s], Canada and British Columbia?
