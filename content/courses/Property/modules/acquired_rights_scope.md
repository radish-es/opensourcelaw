A second question that often arises in acquired rights cases is: **what is the *scope* of the rights acquired?**

- This question assumes that some rights have been acquired based on pre-existing use of the land, while recognizing that this use might change and evolve over time.

- Too narrow an answer might render acquired rights ineffective to their purpose, but too broad an answer could effectively give landowners free reign to flout planning laws.

**Why we're reading it**: The Supreme Court's decision in *Saint-Romuald (City)v Olivier* sets out a legal framework for defining the scope of acquired rights. 

- Both Justice Binnie and Gonthier agree that the "categorical approach" to acquired rights should be rejected but disagree on how the scope of the respondent's rights should be defined in this case.

- To what extent is the disagreement between the judges over the relevance of "personal value judgments" and "the values of society" framed by the modern style of common law thought?
