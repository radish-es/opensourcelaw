title: Airspace Rights
short: Airspace
---


As we have seen, possession plays a key role in establishing property in both things (i.e. chattels) and in the surface of land. The surface owner or possessor of land will, of course, often want to do things that extend well into the airspace above the surface. But the sky is a long way up. How high do rights of possession extendâ€”and more importantly, how are such rights established? Are they a natural extension of surface rights, or is there more a surface owner needs to do in order to establish their rights to such airspace?
