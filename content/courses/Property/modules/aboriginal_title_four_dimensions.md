### Four Dimensions of the Aboriginal Title Doctrine

In our study of the materials this week, we will aim to address four core dimensions of the Aboriginal title doctrine:

1. Proof of Aboriginal title

2. Nature/content and source of Aboriginal title

3. Infringement of Aboriginal title 

4. Duty to consult

Please start by watching the mini-lecture review below, which will revisit and recap the major points on Aboriginal title that we have covered in our historical study so far.
