short: Doctrine of Public Policy

Even where restrictive covenants meet the formal requirements to run with the land described above, there may be circumstances in which the terms of a covenant will be rendered invalid. The courts in *Re Drummond Wren* and *Re Noble and Wolfe v Alley*, below, address two of these circumstances. 

In the first, a court might render invalid and unenforceable a restrictive covenant that is against public policy. In *Re Drummond Wren*, the court was willing to strike down a discriminatory restrictive covenant—similar to the one attached to 3000 Funston Street—on this basis. But in the subsequent case of *Re Noble and Wolfe v Alley* addressing a restrictive covenant with substantially the same terms—decided just a few years later—the courts refused to rely on grounds of public policy.

In the second circumstance, a court might find that a restrictive covenant is a prohibited attempt to restrain alienation. The approach takes us back to our discussion of restraints on alienation in [Week 9](../week9/). From one perspective, this second grounds might be regarded as a subset of the first, based on the public policy and public interest in ensuring the free alienability of property rights. 

How could the doctrine of public policy be applied to the restrictive covenant in our case study at 3000 Funston Street for this week? Is it likely that the restrictions preventing the city from building affordable housing on the site might be found invalid according to this doctrine? On some other grounds?

As you read the cases below to understand the contours of the doctrine of public policy as applied to restrictive covenants, consider again the features of the modern style of common law reasoning and the extent to which they frame and motivate judicial analysis of these cases.
