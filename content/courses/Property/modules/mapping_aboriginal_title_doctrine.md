title: Mapping the Doctrine
short: Mapping

The contemporary doctrine of Aboriginal title is complex and contains several elements that we have not yet encountered in our historical study of this area of law. Below is a map of the caselaw materials this week to help you develop your understanding of the doctrine with an eye toward addressing this week's case study.

### Doctrinal Map to Aboriginal Title

### Step 1: Background

First, start by establishing in your own mind the context of the two leading cases on Aboriginal title. Read [Delgamuukw, paras 1-8](#Delgamuukw) and [Tsilhqot'in, paras 1-24](#Tsilhqot'in) for background on the parties and a brief review of the relevant caselaw. 

### Step 2: Test for Proof of Title

At this step, you are addressing the question of what a plaintiff First Nation needs to demonstrate in order to successfully make out a claim for recognition of Aboriginal title to a particular territory. Read [Delgamuukw, paras 41-55](#delg-proof) and [Tsilhqot'in, paras 25-67](#tsil-proof), watch the mini-lecture following these paragraphs, then review Question 1 of the case study. 

### Step 3: Content and Source of Title

At this step, you are addressing the question of what rights are recognized on the part of a plaintiff First Nation if they are successful in making out their claim at Step 2. The step answers the question (which we have encountered several times before in the course): "What *is* Aboriginal title, from the common law's perspective?" Read [Delgamuukw, paras 9-40](#delg-content) and [Tsilhqot'in, paras 68-77](#tsil-content), watch the mini-lecture following these paragraphs, then review Question 2 of the case study.

### Step 4: Infringement of Title

Finally, once Aboriginal title has been proven and its content and source defined, the courts have left open the possibility that the Crown can justifiably infringe upon the rights associated with that title. What is the test and rationale for infringement? Read [Tsilhqot'in, paras 78-93](#tsil-infringe), watch the mini-lecture following these paragraphs, then review Question 3 of the case study.
