The following is a list of "rapid review" questions. I don't suggest that you address them all in full detail. Instead, aim to briefly consider and then attempt to answer each question in around 5 minutes (per question) to gain a broad review of the material. The primary purpose of these questions is to provide a check on your knowledge and understanding of the Unit 3 materials so far and to help you identify areas for more intensive review. 

### [Week 11 - Land Use Control I (Expropriation)](../week11/)

- How does the Canadian Supreme Court in *McLaren v Caldwell* differ from the U.S. Supreme Court in *Pennsylvania Coal Co v Mahon* in characterizing the issue of *de facto* expropriation?

- What is the legal test for *de facto* expropriation in Canadian law? 

- Why is the concept of "reasonable use of the land" important for determining if a *de facto* expropriation has taken place? How do we know what the "reasonable use of land" is? 

- Was an interest in land acquired by government in our case study of Blue Mountain-Birch Cove Lakes? If not, can you give an example of government action that would amount to the acquisition of an interest in land (short of outright expropriation of title)? 

- Is the loss or gain of land value irrelevant to the analysis of *de facto* expropriation? Why or why not?

### [Week 12 - Land Use Control II (Acquired Rights)](../week12/)

- What is the relationship between the growing use of planning and zoning regimes by municipal authorities and the acquired rights established by common law courts? 

- If the operation of a bicycle repair shop was permitted on land last year, but the zoning was changed to exclude bicycle repair shops last month, does the landowner retain the right to operate a garage on their land?

- What is the legal test for determining the scope of an acquired right? 

- If the owner of land has an acquired right to operate a bicycle repair shop, can they open a garage to repair cars on that same land? What about a busy gas station? 

- How is the "police power" discussed in *Mahon* related to the city's power to regulate "harmonious development and welfare" in *Saint-Romuald v Olivier*?

### [Week 13 - Right to Shelter](../week13/)

- There are 175 available shelter beds in a city; according to the local government's best estimate, there are no more than 150 homeless persons living in the city. Do those experiencing homelessness have a right to shelter in public parks? On city sports fields or on the city's busy waterfront boardwalk? 

- What would it mean to have a right to *adequate* shelter? How, if at all, is "adequacy" related to the choices or preferences of those in need of shelter?

- In what way is a time-limited right to shelter in public parks between 7PM and 9AM similar to or different from a municipal bylaw prohibiting "panhandling" in some downtown areas but permitting it in others? 

### [Week 14 - Restrictive Covenants](../week14/)

- Are restrictive covenants contracts or incidents of property? 

- On what legal basis can a restrictive covenant be enforced against a subsequent owner of the servient lands (i.e., "run with the land")? 

- What legal requirements does a restrictive covenant need to meet in order to be considered valid on its terms? 

- Is a restrictive covenant requiring that agricultural crops grown on the land be cultivated organically one that is negative in nature? What about a covenant requiring upkeep on a fence line? 

- Would a restrictive covenant prohibiting sale of agricultural land to certain named corporations "touch and concern" the land? Would it be otherwise enforceable? 

- What are the legal requirements that must be met in order for a court to apply the public policy doctrine to invalidate a restrictive covenant?

### [Week 15 - Qualified Interests](../week15/)

- In what sense are possessory and future interests both "present interests"? 

- Classify the property interests created in the following devise in trust: "to A for life, then to B for life, then to C if they graduate high school."

- Can the public policy doctrine ever apply to a private bequest? 

- What is the legal relevance of the recitals contained in the trust document in *Canada Trust Co v Ontario*? 

- Why is it significant that the bequest in *McCorkill* is vested rather than contingent?

After you have completed the rapid review questions above, aim to spend some time considering the broader thematic question below.

**Give one or more examples of each of the following judicial moves from the materials in Unit 3:**

- The individual freedoms of property owners and free competition between those interests recedes to the background; public power and demands for social control are drawn into the foreground.

- The relevance of legal distinctions between private and public interests  is explicitly or implicitly contested (or rejected entirely).

- Social consequences of the decision become a primary consideration; formalist reliance on settled principles is diminished.
