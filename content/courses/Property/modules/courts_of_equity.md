To date, we have not had much to say about distinctions between "common law" and "equity" in our course—though you have likely encountered this distinction elsewhere in law school so far. Historically, the divide between common law and equity referred to the adjudication of disputes in separate and distinct courts, which differed in both the types of cases they decided and the content of the legal doctrines they applied. Today, these institutional divisions have been consolidated under the jurisdiction of the superior courts, but doctrinal distinctions remain between "legal" and "equitable" principles that are significant for understanding the operation of property law.

Two aspects of equity are especially relevant to interpreting the reasoning in *Tulk v Moxhay*. First is the idea that equity aims to supplement common law principles rather than displace or contradict them. In practical terms, this often means that a turn to equity is driven by a desire on the part of judges to soften the harder edges of the common law. Second is the idea that equity—being derived from "courts of conscience"—can only act on relationships between specific people (rights *in personum*), not directly on property rights, which are understood to be relationships between an owner and the rest of the world in general (rights *in rem*). 

The upshot of all this for understanding *Tulk v Moxhay* is that, by using equitable principles to enforce the restrictive covenant at issue, the Court does not understand itself to be modifying or affecting property rights directly but merely intervening to ensure that a person who purchases servient land with notice of a covenant cannot escape the consequences based on the somewhat formal justification that they were not parties to the original agreement. Because the downstream owner had notice, they implicitly—if not on contractual grounds—agreed to be bound by its terms.
