title: The Relative Nature of Title and Possession
short: Relative Nature of Title and Possession
---


Our case study this week asks you to consider both conventional and critical perspectives on the significance of moving from possession to title, in the context of land in African Nova Scotian communities. To better understand the legal groundwork for this debate, we now return to the basic question of what rights are afforded to someone in possession of land but who lacks formal title. *Asher v Whitlock*, below, engages the issue of what happens when two claimants—neither of whom hold title—make competing claims to land. In the course of answering that question, the Court elaborates on the rights of parties in possession. Because of the style in which some mid-nineteenth century law reports were written—presenting the lawyers at trial in dialogue with the judges, followed by the court's final judgement—*Asher* also provides an opportunity to reconnect with ideas about patterns of common law argument that we addressed in Unit 1.

*Asher v Whitlock* illustrates and affirms a basic premise we encountered in weeks 4 and 5: possession and title are distinctive legal concepts. However, the case also tells us something more. First, possessory rights can co-exist with title (notice that the title holder is not actually a party in *Asher*). Second, in the face of conflicting possessory claims, the common law has developed a rule to resolve those claims. What is this rule as expressed by the Court in *Asher*, and what rationales if any does the Court offer for adhering to it?
