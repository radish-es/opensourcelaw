title: Mi'kmaw Land Tenure
---

The Court in *Syliboy* deployed each of the core themes of colonialism in property law we introduced in Week 1 in order to interpret the 1752 Peace and Friendship Treaty. The *Syliboy* decision provided a deeply problematic footing on which to set the common law's understanding treaty rights and in some significant ways tracked the developing common law doctrine of Aboriginal title. But despite the *Syliboy* decision's long influence on treaty interpretation in Mi'kma'ki, in its aftermath Mi'kmaw jurists continued to offer alternative interpretations grounded in the Mi'kmaw legal order and worldview. 

James (Sa’ke’j) Youngblood Henderson explains Mi'kmaw law in the context of treaty in the following way:[^henderson1995]

> The prerogative Treaties enabled the two worldviews and different societies to make a new normative world using the irony of jurisdictions, obligations and rights. To live in the new legal world required each culture to know not only the meaning of the alliance and its terms, but also the connections or transformations that resulted when one normative system passed through another. The prerogative Treaties constructed, through mutual consent, a new normative system out of the various constructions of reality and visions of what the world might be.

> For example, the Wabanaki and Mikmaq applied the customary concept of harmony and forgiveness to the English. Specifically, article 2 of the *Mikmaw Compact*, 1752, stated that "all Transactions during the Late War on both sides be buried in Oblivion with the Hatchet." This fragile quest for an explicit order between the diverse federations through consensual Treaties provided the foundation upon which developed the first British Empire and their colonies, and eventually the United Kingdom.

Professor Youngblood Henderson goes on to describe Mi'kmaq relationships to land:

> The relationship between the Mi'kmaw and the land embodies the
essence of the intimate sacred order. As humans, they have and retain an
obligation to protect the order and a right to share its uses, but only the
future unborn children in the invisible sacred realm of the next seven
generations had any ultimate ownership of the land. In the custom of the
Mi'kmaq, the Santé Mawi'omi was and is the trustee of the sacred order and
territory for the future generations. Part of its duty is to regulate the natural
resources of Mi'kma'ki among the allied people and through the Nikmanen
trading customs increase the bio-diversity. This is more of a management
right to ensure discipline in consumption of the resources, rather than the
concept of ownership.

> Inherent in this sacred order is the conviction that the resources had to
be renewed as well as shared. Rather than managed, which implied
human domination, the Mikmaq developed rituals for sharing or harmonizing
 the human and spiritual realms. These renewal rituals and
ceremonies brought the people and the land into balance thereby 
achieving basic subsistence and material well-being. These rituals and 
ceremonies created a harmony which emphasized stability and the minimization
of risk for the harvesting of the resources rather than growth and the
accumulation of wealth. The quest for harmony also created the need for
diversification by trade and modification of habitats, thereby 
developing surplus capacities and sharing.

> Sharing of resources is the equivalent of consensus in creating 
governing structures. Just as the managers of shared resources sustain them, the
leaders of communities, districts, and nations are managers of shared
authority and spaces.' Sharing of the harvest is neither random nor
universal, but based on patterns, kinship and correspondence. It is an
honour, a duty and a privilege; those who have a little more to share may
gain prestige, influence and dignity.

> Managing a space and sharing is viewed as an integral part of the
ethical development of a Mi'kmaq. It is important for the development of
family, friendship and self. Mi'kmaq see no distinction between collective
or individual interests. The goal of creating a sustaining space and a
sharing and caring community in which everyone can participate and
belong is the ultimate interest. Everyone must come to this realization;
they must come to understand the beauty and dignity of maintaining,
protecting, and renewing their family space and traditions. Through this
developmental process, Mi'kmaq establish a clear understanding of
oneself as a human and in relation to the environment. Through this
process, Mi'kmaq understand the needs of the biological realms and the
ethical significance of their desires, freedoms and responsibilities.

**Compare and contrast the principles described by Professor Youngblood Henderson with (1) the interpretation of the 1752 Treaty in *R v Syliboy* and (2) the interpretation of Aboriginal title in *St. Catherine's Milling*.**
