Next week, we will turn to the contemporary doctrine of Aboriginal title as developed in a series of recent cases by the Supreme Court of Canada. 

Together, the two cases you encountered this week—*Calder* in 1973 and *Guerin* in 1984—represented something of a turning point in common law Aboriginal title, in which the Supreme Court began to depart in some significant ways from the course charted by the Privy Council in *St. Catherine's Milling*. The mini-lecture below identifies some of these departure points, as well as those aspects of common law Aboriginal title that remained unchanged and continued to be grounded in the doctrine of discovery. These key points will serve as an introduction to the material for next week.
