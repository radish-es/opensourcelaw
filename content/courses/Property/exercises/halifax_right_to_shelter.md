title: 'The Right to Shelter in Halifax '
short: Right to Shelter
---


Our applied problem this week asks you to engage directly with events surrounding the right to shelter in Halifax over the past few years, including attempts by unhoused people to create shelters in public parks around the city during the pandemic and responses by neighbours, police, and the HRM Council. 

Please start by reviewing the following sources:

- A CBC News article entitled *[What a B.C. court ruling could mean for Halifax park evictions](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/what-a-b-c-court-ruling-could-mean-for-halifax-park-evictions-1.6319104)*, published soon after the British Columbia Supreme Court released its decision in *Bamberger*, below.

- The most recent available statistics on homelessness in Halifax published by the [Canadian Observatory on Homelessness](https://www.homelesshub.ca/community-profile/halifax). 

- A new [staff report submitted to the Regional Council](https://cdn.halifax.ca/sites/default/files/documents/city-hall/regional-council/221122rc1519.pdf) describing the work and recommendations of the *Lived Experience Advisory Committee on Homelessness for HRM*. 

After reviewing these materials, ask yourself the following questions as you read the cases on the right to shelter below:

- How might advocates challenge the legality of the park evictions that took place in Halifax during the summer of 2021? Is such a challenge likely to be successful? What barriers might the claimants encounter? 

- What legal and policy responses should HRM Council undertake to address the needs to unhoused people in the city in light of the emerging right to shelter?
