One or more of the arguments pairs constructed by Justice Panelli and Justice Mosk in *Moore* relate directly to our [central question in the course](../week1#Market) regarding the relationship between law and markets. Consider in particular the judges' debate over "policy reasons" for extending conversion liability to biological cells (the [green argument pair](#green_1) in the decisions above). 

**To what extent does this debate rest on the three pervasive assumptions (natural, neutral and necessary) about law and markets (here, a market in biological cells) that we discussed in Week 1? Having identified the work of these assumptions in the case, how might you critique the judges' shared approach to the debate?**
