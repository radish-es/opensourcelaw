title: Obligations
short: 'Obligations'
---

For this exercise, start by taking some time to think about the obligations you bring to this property law course. You might want to start by thinking about what obligations have confront by coming to class each week. What gets you out of your home and into the law school? What responsibilities do you encounter as you try to understanding and complete your weekly readings (and to whom)? Below are some further questions to help guide your reflections. Take around ten minutes to make a list of all the relevant obligations that come to your mind in this context. 

- *Community*: Do you hold any obligations to your family, friends, classmates, teachers, employers (present or future), or other groups or individuals when working in this course? 

- *Place*: Do you feel any obligations relating to places you are from or have lived in? Any obligations coming from the place or spaces we are learning property law in?

- *Self*: Do you feel any obligations to yourself, your own morals or beliefs when you think about learning property law? 

**STOP: Don't read further until you have completed your initial list of obligations.**

Now think about how some of your different obligations might conflict with one another. Pick one obligation from your list and imagine that it is the only one you hold. How would you approach this course if you only had to worry about that single obligation? Would your approach change if you introduced an additional obligation from your list? How? Take another ten minutes to identify and write down any conflicts or tensions that appear once you examine your obligations in relation to one another. 

To help guide you in this exercise, consider the following example: 

> As your professor in this course--who decides what to teach and how to teach it--I hold an obligation to ensure that you gain "a general understanding of the core legal concepts applicable to the practice of law in Canada" and "an understanding of the principles that apply to private relationships" in the field of property law. That obligation is defined, and to a degree monitored, by the Federation of Law Societies of Canada through their *[National Requirement](https://flsc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/National-Requirement-Jan-2018-FIN.pdf)*. It is an obligation that I owe to you as students, to your future clients and colleagues, and to institutions including the law school and the law society. I also hold an obligation to ensure that you gain a critical understanding of how the everyday application of property law principles contributes to the dispossession of Indigenous communities. That obligation is not mentioned anywhere in the *National Requirement* but is inherent in a commitment to sustain and repair relationships created by the Peace and Friendship Treaties. If I had only one or the other of these obligations to satisfy, I would teach two very different courses. Time and resource constraints often make it challenging to satisfy both of these obligations at once, but there are also deeper conflicts that arise, including between legal principles or rules across different legal orders. I am also limited and biased by my own knowledge, background and training. 

Please complete this exercise on your own before class. We will take some time to discuss your reflections and how they should inform our approach to the rest of the course in our class meeting this week.
