title: Land Title Clarification in African Nova Scotian Communities
short: Land Title
---


The context for our case study this week is described in two excerpts below from recent decisions of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court. Both cases address provincial legislation called the *Land Titles Clarification Act*, RSNS 1989, c 250, through which individuals in possession of land can apply to have their land title "clarified"--that is, given formal legal recognition--where title does not exist or is uncertain. The excerpts from *Downey* and *Beals*, below, sketch the basic features of this legislation and its connection to the historical settlement of African Nova Scotians. 

Please note that, at this point, we are not reading either *Downey* or *Beals* for the specific facts of the dispute before the courts or for the legal principles involved. Instead, these excerpts provide the background context needed to understand our case study. 

As you read the two excerpts, try to identify what rationales are offered by the courts for the process of land clarification. **What is the purpose and objective of the *Land Titles Clarification Act*? Why, in the courts' view, is the move from possession to title important for African Nova Scotians and their communities?**
