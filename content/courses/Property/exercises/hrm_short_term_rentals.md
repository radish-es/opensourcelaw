### Background

As in many cities across Canada, short-term retals have become a hot button issue in the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM). According to the HRM website:[^hrm2021]

> Short-Term Rentals (STRs) are temporary overnight accommodations rented out for a few nights or weeks at a time. In recent years, the prevalence and popularity of STRs has grown through online platforms like Airbnb, VRBO and HomeAway. While STRs provide a unique form of a tourist accommodation and can have benefits for the local economy, their recent popularity raises concerns about their impact on residential neighborhoods and the availability of properties for long-term rental [i.e. the rental housing supply].

STR land-uses have not to date been prohibited or otherwise regulated under HRMs Regional Municipal Planning Strategy (RMPS) or relevant land-use bylaws. In September 2020, the Halifax Regional Council directed municipal staff to begin work on proposed amendments to the RMPS and all applicable secondary planning strategies and land-use bylaws that would establish policies and regulations for STRs in residential areas of the city.

HRM's Halifax Mainland Land-Use Bylaw (LUB) currently lists the following permitted land uses in the R-2P Zone ("General Residential"):

- buildings containing not more than 4 apartments;
- a semi-detached dwelling;
- a duplex dwelling;
- a detached one-family dwelling;
- the office of a professional person located in the dwelling house used by such professional person as his private residence;
- home occupation;
- a public park or playground;
- a church and church hall;
- a golf course;
- a tennis court;
- a yacht or boat club;
- a public recreational centre;
- a day care facility for not more than 8 children in conjunction with a
dwelling;
- a special care home containing not more than ten persons including resident staff members;
- uses accessory to any of the foregoing uses.

"Home occupation" is defined in the Halifax Mainland LUB as a "Bed and Breakfast" where the proprietor is a resident of the dwelling unit. The by-law limits the permitted use to one home occupation per lot. 

Note that zoning designations in the Halifax Mainland LUB apply to land lots as a whole (not to the one or more residential units that may exist on a given lot).

### Hypothetical

Suppose that the HRM Regional Council passes amendments to the Regional MPS and Halifax Mainland LUB that prohibits STRs in all residential zones.

After Council adopts these amendments, a client comes to you for advice. The client owns a low-rise apartment building containing four two-bedroom apartment units in an area of Halifax zoned R-2P. For about one year prior to the zoning amendment, the client—who does not live in the building—was regularly listing and renting one of the building units on a nightly basis through AirB&B, from May to August. For the remaining months of the year, the unit was leased to university students on a fixed 8-month term. Two of the other units in the building were rented to long-term tenants at market rates, while the remaining unit was rent-subsidized and leased to long-term lower-income tenants. The building is located in an area of the city that has seen an influx of tourist activity and its corresponding economic benefits, but the area is also grappling with the associated consequences of rising housing prices and neighbourhood gentrification. 

The client is seeking your advice about their plans to convert the rent-subsidized unit in the building into an additional short-term rental listed on AirB&B. They plan to list this and the original short-term rental unit throughout the year for rent on a weekly basis, in hopes that this model will be attractive to family vacationers (who tend to be more subdued and less annoying to the neighbours compared to weekend partygoers). Your client says that, prior to the recent by-law amendments regulating STRs, they believed that their use of the land was permitted as a "home occupation" and that the rights to continue this use are now "grandfathered in". The client also plans to offer an "enhanced" vacation experience to their AirB&B renters by supplying a personal chef who will cook a gourmet meal on-site for one or more nights of their stay (a food service use which, on its own, is prohibited in residential zones).  

Are your client's plans likely to be challenged successfully by HRM in court? Why or why not?
