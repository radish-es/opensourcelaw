It was undisputed in *Asher* that Thomas Williamson had come into possession of the land at issue by "inclosing" it—presumably, by building a fence or erecting some other sort of boundary marker (as well as constructing a cottage on it). Erecting a fence is a quintessential  way of marking something as "mine", and generally sends a clear message to others to "keep out". What other practices do we understand as signalling possession? Are these practices always meant to be recognized in the eyes of the law, or do they have other audiences? 

For example, in some cities in the United States—famously, Chicago—it is common practice for residents who dig out public street parking spaces after a snow storm to place a chair in the spot while their car is away. This practice (calling "dibs") is widely understood to mark the spot as "theirs", at least for the time being. It is not, however, an uncontested practice. Calling dibs on a parking spot or violating the norm it represents has been known to lead to heated arguments between neighbours, and in some cases, outright violence.

**Look around your neighbourhood this week. Can you identify ways in which people attempt to signal or "speak" their possession to others?**
