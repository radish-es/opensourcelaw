Please read [this CBC News article,](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/indian-act-horrible-existence-senator-christmas-1.4149551) in which Senator Dan Christmas, the first Mi'kmaq member of the Canadian Senate, describes some of the challenges the Membertou First Nation has faced with respect to lands governance under the federal *Indian Act* and how his community has responded to these challenges. 

As the article notes, Membertou has recently opted out of the lands-related provisions of the *Indian Act* and opted into an alternative federal legislative regime, the *First Nations Lands Management Act* (*FNLMA*). The *FNLMA* enables participating First Nations to create their own land code dealing with property rights and governance on their reserve lands.

Membertou adopted its current Land Code under the *FNLMA* in 2019. Some key provisions from this Land Code are excerpted below.

### *Membertou Land Code*, 2019 (excerpts)

**Preamble**

WHEREAS Membertou is a part of the Mi’kmaw Nation whose ancestors have used and occupied Mi’kma’ki from time immemorial;

WHEREAS Membertou has an unextinguished right to self-determination, as affirmed by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People, which includes a right to govern itself, its members and its lands;

WHEREAS Membertou has an unextinguished and inherent right of self-governance which emanates from its people, culture, language, land and aboriginal and treaty rights, which are recognized by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982;

WHEREAS Membertou has a profound relationship with the lands and waters that is rooted in respect for the Spiritual value of the Earth and the gifts of the Creator. Membertou wishes to preserve and protect its relationship with the lands and waters as well as to ensure sustainability and appropriate stewardship for the benefit of future generations;

WHEREAS Membertou hereby recognizes and affirms the existence of Treaty and Aboriginal Rights as separate, distinct and unaffected by this Land Code;

WHEREAS Membertou hereby recognizes and affirms the collective rights of its members to the land, water and resources;

WHEREAS Membertou has entered into the Framework Agreement on First Nation Land Management with Canada, as amended, and which was ratified on behalf of the Government of Canada by the First Nations Land Management Act;

AND WHEREAS Membertou, as an aspect of its unextinguished right to self-determination and its unextinguished and inherent right of self-governance, has jurisdiction to create rules for the resolution of issues on Membertou lands, waters and resources, rather than having its lands, waters and their resources managed on its behalf under the Indian Act or any other statute;

NOW THEREFORE, this Land Code is hereby enacted as the fundamental land law of Membertou as follows: 

[…]

3.6 The structures, organizations and procedures established by or under its Land Code shall be interpreted in accordance with the culture, traditions and customs of Membertou, unless otherwise provided.

(a) permanent possession of the land;

(b) benefit from the resources in and of the land;

(c) grant subsidiary interests, licences and permits in the land;

(d) transfer, devise or otherwise dispose of the land to another Member; and

The materials we study this week will help you to address the following questions in the context of housing and business development on the Membertou First Nation's reserve lands under its *Land Code*:

1. How are the barriers described by Senator Christmas shaped by the legal structure of property rights and lands governance defined under the *Indian Act* and by the Supreme Court of Canada in *Guerin v R*? 

2. How does the Membertou *Land Code* under the *FNLMA* change the structure of property rights and lands governance on Membertou's reserve lands? What are the potential consequences (benefits or challenges) of this move for on-reserve housing and business development?

3. What possibilities, if any, does adopting a land code under the *FNLMA* open up for the development and application of Mi'kmaw laws related to housing? What questions would you ask to understand more about this issue?
