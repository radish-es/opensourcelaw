title: the Membertou First Nation's Transition to the FNLMA
short: Membertou First Nation and the FNLMA
---



Please read [this CBC News article,](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/indian-act-horrible-existence-senator-christmas-1.4149551) in which Senator Dan Christmas, the first Mi'kmaq member of the Canadian Senate, describes some of the challenges the Membertou First Nation has faced with respect to lands governance under the federal *Indian Act* and how his community has responded to these challenges. 

As the article notes, Membertou has recently opted out of the lands-related provisions of the *Indian Act* and opted into an alternative federal legislative regime, the *First Nations Lands Management Act* (*FNLMA*). The *FNLMA* provides a framework for participating First Nations to create their own Land Code dealing with property rights and governance on their reserve lands.

Membertou adopted its current Land Code under the *FNLMA* in 2019. Some key provisions from this Land Code are excerpted below. 

### *Membertou Land Code*, 2019 (excerpts)

**Preamble**

WHEREAS Membertou is a part of the Mi’kmaw Nation whose ancestors have used and occupied Mi’kma’ki from time immemorial;

WHEREAS Membertou has an unextinguished right to self-determination, as affirmed by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People, which includes a right to govern itself, its members and its lands;

WHEREAS Membertou has an unextinguished and inherent right of self-governance which emanates from its people, culture, language, land and aboriginal and treaty rights, which are recognized by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982;

WHEREAS Membertou has a profound relationship with the lands and waters that is rooted in respect for the Spiritual value of the Earth and the gifts of the Creator. Membertou wishes to preserve and protect its relationship with the lands and waters as well as to ensure sustainability and appropriate stewardship for the benefit of future generations;

WHEREAS Membertou hereby recognizes and affirms the existence of Treaty and Aboriginal Rights as separate, distinct and unaffected by this Land Code;

WHEREAS Membertou hereby recognizes and affirms the collective rights of its members to the land, water and resources;

WHEREAS Membertou has entered into the Framework Agreement on First Nation Land Management with Canada, as amended, and which was ratified on behalf of the Government of Canada by the First Nations Land Management Act;

AND WHEREAS Membertou, as an aspect of its unextinguished right to self-determination and its unextinguished and inherent right of self-governance, has jurisdiction to create rules for the resolution of issues on Membertou lands, waters and resources, rather than having its lands, waters and their resources managed on its behalf under the Indian Act or any other statute;

NOW THEREFORE, this Land Code is hereby enacted as the fundamental land law of Membertou as follows: 

[…]

3.6 The structures, organizations and procedures established by or under its Land Code shall be interpreted in accordance with the culture, traditions and customs of Membertou, unless otherwise provided.

3.7 The Mi’kmaw language may be used to clarify the meaning of any provision in this Land Code, if the meaning of that provision is not otherwise clear in English.

[…]

7.1 The Council may, in accordance with this Land Code, make laws respecting the development, conservation, protection, management, use and possession of Membertou Land, Waters and Resources, and Interests and Licenses in relation to those Membertou Land, Waters and Resources. This power includes the power to make laws in relation to any matter necessary or ancillary to the making of laws in relation to Membertou Lands, Water and Resources.

[…]

25.5 A person who is not a Member may hold a lease, licence, easement, mortgage or permit in Membertou lands.

25.6 The written consent of Council shall be obtained for the original grant of a lease, licence, easement or permit in community land, waters and resources to a person who is not a Member.

25.7 Notwithstanding section 25.5, if Council has consented to the original grant of a lease in Membertou Land, Waters and Resources to a person who is not a Member, that leasehold interest may be subsequently mortgaged, transferred or assigned without the consent of Council or approval of members.

28.1 Council may enact laws providing for an Interest in Membertou Land, Waters and Resources that entitles a Member holding that Interest to:

(a) permanent possession of the land;

(b) benefit from the resources in and of the land;

(c) grant subsidiary interests, licences and permits in the land;

(d) transfer, devise or otherwise dispose of the land to another Member; and

(e) any other rights, consistent with this Land Code, that are attached to Certificates of Possession under the Indian Act.

28.2 For greater certainty, no interest under section 28.1, may be granted to or held by a person who is not a Member.

28.3 Members may transfer or assign their Interest in Membertou Land, Waters and Resources to Membertou or a Member without the consent of Council.

[…]

28.5 There shall be no transfer or assignment of an Interest in Membertou land without the written consent of Council, except for:

(a) transfers between Members;

(b) transfers that occur by operation of law, including transfers of estate by testamentary disposition; and

(c) transfers in accordance with the Membertou Family Homes Law, 2016. reserve law.

The materials we study this week will help you to address the following questions in the context of housing and business development on the Membertou First Nation's reserve lands under its *Land Code*:

1. How are the barriers described by Senator Christmas shaped by the legal structure of property rights and lands governance defined under the *Indian Act* and by the Supreme Court of Canada in *Guerin*, below? 

2. How does the Membertou *Land Code* under the *FNLMA* change the structure of property rights and lands governance on Membertou's reserve lands? What does it not change? What are the potential consequences (benefits or challenges) of this move for community housing and business development?

3. What possibilities, if any, does adopting a land code under the *FNLMA* open up for the development and application of Mi'kmaw laws related to housing? What questions would you ask to understand more about this issue?
