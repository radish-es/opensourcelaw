To better understand some of the challenges associated with creating a meaningful land acknowledgement, consider a recent controversy in Wolastoqey territory. In October of 2021, New Brunswick's Attorney General issued a memo to provincial employees called "First Nation Protocol on Acknowledging Ancestral Territory." The memo was purportedly a response to the Wolastoqey Nation's ongoing claim, in the Canadian courts, [for recognition of Aboriginal title to land that covers about half of present day New Brunswick](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/wolastoqey-nation-filing-for-title-claim-against-new-brunswick-1.5750955) (we will examine the details of this kind of claim later in the course). In the memo, provincial employees were instructed not to give territorial or title acknowledgements in the context of their work. Instead, they were to use only an approved "ancestral acknowledgement" as follows:

> "We (I) respectfully acknowledge the territory in which we gather as the ancestral homelands of the Wolastoqey, Mi'gmaw and Peskotomuhkati peoples. We strive for respectful relationships with all the peoples of this province as we search for collective healing and true reconciliation and honour this beautiful land together."

This acknowledgement intentionally excluded terms like "unceded" or "unsurrendered." The Attorney General's memo quickly attracted media attention and condemnation from several angles. The six chiefs of the Wolastoqey Nation denounced the memo in a public statement, calling it "gag order" which ignores the "historical truth of lands within New Brunswick." 

***How do we see the features of ahistoricism, invisibility, and subsumation in the Attorney General's instruction to use an "ancestral acknowledgement"? Does Dalhousie's land acknowledgement avoid some or all of these three features?***
