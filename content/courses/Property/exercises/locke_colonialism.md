title: Locke & Colonialism
short: Locke Colonialism
---

Several writers have explored and debated the ways in which Locke's influential works sought to justify an expanding British colonialism at the time when the *Second Treatise* was published. As part of that project, questions about property and possession of land were fundamental. While Locke appears to acknowledge that British law may recognize the possession of Indigenous peoples, he simultaneously lays down justifications for undermining any possessory entitlements--or for ignoring them altogether. 

Take a moment to briefly revisit the *[Three Themes of Colonialism in Law](../week1/#three-themes-of-colonialism-in-law)* from Week 1. Now consider how these themes appear in Locke's treatise. One good place to start is the following passage:

> [H]e who appropriates land to himself by his labour, does not lessen, but increase the common stock of mankind […] for I ask, whether in the wild woods and uncultivated waste of America, left to nature, without any improvement, tillage or husbandry, a thousand acres yield the needy and wretched inhabitants as many conveniencies of life, as ten acres of equally fertile land do in Devonshire, where they are well cultivated.

The following prompts might also help the focus your analysis:

- **Ahistoricism**: How does Locke portray Indigenous peoples and Indigenous legal orders in his treatise? How does he approach the transformation of "land" into "property"?

- **Invisibility**: At the time Locke wrote this treatise, Britain had already established colonies in America. What assumptions does Locke rely on in his treatise, and how might these assumptions also work to justify British colonization?

- **Subsumation**: In what ways does Locke portray his treatise as universal, despite being rooted in seventeenth-century British Christianity? What contradictions might this supposed universality obscure? 

Keep these questions and your answers in mind when we return to these topics next week.
