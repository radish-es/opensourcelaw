A testator, recently deceased, has two surviving adult children who are the sole beneficiaries of the testator's will. The will establishes a private trust whose terms stipulate that, in order for the eldest of the two children to receive their share of the estate property they must divorce and cease to cohabitate with their spouse. If the eldest child fails to meet this condition within five years of the testator's decease, the whole residue of the estate will pass to the other beneficiary. 

The eldest child brings an action challenging the validity of the will, arguing that the condition exists because their spouse belongs to a faith tradition of which the testator—in their own words—"disapproved". While the will itself makes no mention of the reasons for the bequest or the condition, plaintiff claims to possess written and oral evidence outside the will that expresses the testator's beliefs.

How would you describe the property interests created in this will? Do you think the plaintiff is likely to succeed in challenging the will?
