### Problem 1: First Possession

Two children are playing on a beach and see an old abandoned boat washed up on shore. They both run for it. The faster one nearly reaches the vessel but trips on a piece of driftwood and sprains their ankle. The second child then overtakes the first, jumps on board and declares the boat "mine!". Who owns the boat?

### Problem 2: Airspace Rights

You client recently purchased a winter cottage, on a modest tract of land at the side of a mountain, adjacent to a popular ski resort in a small town. The resort owns land above and below the cottage and has recently unveiled plans to run one portion of a new ski lift directly over your client's land. Permanent cables for the lift would run less than 20 feet above the chalet. Is there a legal basis on which your client could challenge development of the proposed ski lift? Does it matter that the resort cannot continue to operate without expanding its access to the mountain and that over half of the town's residents are employed there?
