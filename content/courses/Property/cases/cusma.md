#### Article 14.8: Expropriation and Compensation

> 1 No Party shall expropriate or nationalize a covered investment either directly or indirectly through measures equivalent to expropriation or nationalization (expropriation), except:
>
>> (a) for a public purpose;
>>
>> (b) in a non-discriminatory manner;
>>
>> (c) on payment of prompt, adequate, and effective compensation in accordance with paragraphs 2, 3, and 4; and
>>
>> (d) in accordance with due process of law.

#### Annex 14-6 Expropriation

The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:

> 1 An action or a series of actions by a Party cannot constitute an expropriation unless it interferes with a tangible or intangible property right or property interest in an investment.
> 
> 2 Article 14.8.1 (Expropriation and Compensation) addresses two situations. The first is direct expropriation, in which an investment is nationalized or otherwise directly expropriated through formal transfer of title or outright seizure.
> 
> 3 The second situation addressed by Article 14.8.1 (Expropriation and Compensation) is indirect expropriation, in which an action or series of actions by a Party has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure.
>
>> (a) The determination of whether an action or series of actions by a Party, in a specific fact situation, constitutes an indirect expropriation, requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors:
>>
>>> (i) the economic impact of the government action, although the fact that an action or series of actions by a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred,
>>>
>>> (ii) the extent to which the government action interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations,19 and
>>>
>>> (iii) the character of the government action, including its object, context, and intent.
>>
>> (b) Non-discriminatory regulatory actions by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as health, safety and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriations, except in rare circumstances.
