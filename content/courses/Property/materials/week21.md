This week we explore a contemporary perspective on the question of *de facto* expropriation, which we first addressed in [Week 8](../week8/) and then revisited in [Week 12](../week12/). 

Here we continue to see the courts' turn toward a contemporary style of common law reasoning that rests on a pragmatic combination of elements from both the classical and modern perspectives. As you work through the materials this week, aim to identify where these elements of earlier styles appear and ask yourself whether their combination results in a coherent framework for legal reasoning.
