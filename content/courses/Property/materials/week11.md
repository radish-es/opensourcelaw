In our final class this term, we return to the context of treaty to develop a perspective on the material we have studied so far. In Week 5 we studied the historical roots of the common law doctrine of Aboriginal title and saw, in *St. Catherine’s Milling*, how classical legal thought framed the courts' conclusion that Indigenous land rights were “personal” rather than “proprietary”. We left off with the observation that beneath the issue of Aboriginal title foregrounded in St. Catherine’s Milling was the doctrine of terra nullius (“land belonging to no one”). Aspects of terra nullius—paired with the doctrine of discovery—undergird courts' continued assumption of Crown sovereignty and the exclusion of Indigenous sovereignties up to the present day. One consequence of this doctrine has been to largely exclude Indigenous legal orders and legal interpretations from the consciousness of the common law.

At the same time, we have seen throughout this term that the common law's role in disrupting Indigenous relationships with land is broader than the doctrine of Aboriginal title. Stretching back to the common law roots in the doctrines of tenure and estates and to Locke's concept of possession, we have seen that the whole mechanism is one designed to transform *land* into *property* and thereby establish the basis for legal *dominium* of the individual as the central figure of Western liberalism.

The treaty context offers an opportunity for us to step outside this frame of legal liberalism and discover alternative possibilities for legal relationships to land and territory. Treaty relationships between Indigenous nations and the Crown are widespread in Canada, but they are also diverse and difficult to generalize. This week we will focus on the treaty context in Mi’kma’ki / Atlantic Canada to understand how the Peace and Friendship Treaties were established in the mid-eighteenth century and then interpreted in the classical period. We will see that, with the Nova Scotia County Court’s decision in R v Syliboy, treaty interpretation in the region became highly restrictive and was based on a rejection of the idea of nation-to-nation relationships and of Mi’kmaw systems of law and governance.

Nevertheless, Mi’kmaq people continue to use and develop their systems of law and governance. We will look briefly at one description of Mi’kmaw land tenure and ask how we might understand this system in comparison to the common law structures we have studied so far in the course.
