For the past three weeks we have examined, from various angles, the way public authorities—mainly, local governments in the urban context—regulate and control the use of both private and public land. We noted, at the beginning of [Week 12](../week12/), that modern, forward-looking land use planning and zoning regimes emerged in Canada by the mid-20th century to replace more decentralized and reactive forms of land-use control, such as private nuisance actions adjudicated by the common law courts (which we studied in [Week 7](../week7/) of the course).

This story about the move from private nuisance actions to public land-use controls, however, needs to be complicated a little further. Certain "private" forms of land-use regulation are still in widespread use. One of the most pervasive—but often least noticed—is the *restrictive covenant*. 

From one point of view, restrictive covenants look like a fairly straightforward promise by one landowner to another—a promise to refrain from doing something on one's own land. One landowner might promise not to cut down the trees in their yard, for example, or promise not to paint their house a garish shade of bright green. But from a legal perspective, restrictive covenants are much more than this. Not only do covenants represent a sort of contractual promise between parties, they help to define the durable "bundle of rights" in the land itself—that is, covenants are said to *run with the land* and can, at least in theory, long outlast the original parties to the covenant. As discussed below, this possibility raises some difficult questions for courts in how they define the basic character of covenants along with their consequences.

This week, we will study one specific issue with respect to restrictive covenants: what distinguishes a valid, enforceable covenant from an invalid (and therefore unenforceable) one? Part of this determination, as we will see, turns on a set of formal criteria for establishing a valid covenant. But validity can also be determined through an analysis of the various extrinsic reasons why courts might refuse to enforce an otherwise valid covenant. Here, we will focus mainly on the grounds of "public policy" as a reason for refusing to enforce covenants found to be discriminatory or against other foundational values.
