In our final week of the course, we will return to where we started and review what we've learned over the arch of the course as a whole. 

Recall that, when we first read the Supreme Court's decision in *Harrison v Carswell* in Week 2, we analyzed the case in terms of its "vocabulary"â€”that is, the structure of argument and counter-argument used explicitly by the judges to justify their legal conclusions on the facts. Left unanswered in that analysis was the question of how we know which judge's decision, as a whole, is more persuasive from a legal perspective. 

We can now return to that question and apply the tools for analyzing the "grammar" of common law thought that we have developed throughout the course. 

What makes *Harrison v Carswell* unique among the decisions we read this is that, from our current standpoint, it looks like a kind of clash or contest between classical and modern styles of common law reasoning.  This week we will look at two questions--please consider both as you re-read the case:

- **How do Justice Dickson's and Chief Justice Laskin's decisions typify either the classical or modern styles?** 

- **If you were to write a new decision in *Harrison v Carswell* from the perspective of the contemporary style, what would it say? What do you think would be the result in the case?**
