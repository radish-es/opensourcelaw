Last week, we saw that remedies in nuisance are one legal tool used by property owners—with mixed success—to stop their neighbours from adversely affecting use and enjoyment of the owner's land. Nuisance, in other words, is one legal means to *exclude* others from doing something that limits owners' freedom related to property. This means of exclusion, however, unavoidably limits the freedom of others to use their land as they choose. In these situations, the courts must choose whose rights should win out. In doing so, they struggle to address the fundamental dilemma of conflicting freedoms inherent in legal liberalism.  

Other cases—like the one we will study this week—raise a different aspect of the right to exclude. These cases concern the legal protections afforded to landowners in excluding the state itself from various types of "infringements" on an owner's property. They engage the state's power of *expropriation* (governmental power to take away property rights), which in some contexts is called the power of *eminent domain*.  

In the most dramatic cases, the state exercises its expropriation power to take private title to land (for example, to build a highway or an airport). But there are many other scenarios in which the state leaves title in the hands of the landowner but "takes" one or more sticks in the ownership bundle by way of regulation or other legislative act. In their broadest sense, such "regulatory takings" or "constructive expropriations" are potentially ubiquitous, ranging from environmental regulations to building codes and zoning bylaws. Similar to claims in nuisance, these state activities have sometimes been cast as violations of claimant landowners' traditional rights of property.

A key legal issue is to what extent landowners in Canada can exclude governments from expropriating or otherwise regulating their property rights in the absence of compensation. Unlike the United States and several modern constitutional democracies, Canada lacks any constitutional protections for private property against state attempts to limit or take away those rights. Lacking such explicit protections, it has generally necessary for claimants to find other legal routes to compel compensation for expropriation of property. 

What protections do exist mainly take the form of provincial expropriation statutes. These statutes do not prevent government from expropriating property *per se*, but they do impose certain restrictions on this activity, such as that it must be undertaken for a public purpose and that adequate compensation to landowners must be paid. Such compensation is clearly required when title is taken away by the state. Much less clear is to what extent governments in Canada are responsible for compensating landowners for regulatory activity that "takes" one or more sticks in the bundle. As the United States Supreme Court observed in *Pennsylvania Coal Co. v Mahon*, "[g]overnment hardly could go on if, to some extent, values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law."

A crucial moment in the history of Anglo-Canadian legal thinking on issues of expropriation surfaced around a dispute over water rights in Ontario toward the end of the nineteenth century. The dispute was between the lumbering operations of one Peter McLaren and one Boyd Caldwell. Before delving into that controversy further, we will begin with a brief primer on common law water rights, which differ in several important ways from property in land.
