This week, we complete our study of Indigenous land rights, with a focus on the common law doctrine of Aboriginal title. We have traced the evolution of that doctrine from the Royal Proclamation in 1763, through *St. Catherine's Milling* in the late nineteenth century and *Calder* and *Guerin* in the late twentieth century. The contemporary path of the Aboriginal title doctrine since those cases has been charted through a combination of constitutional reform, litigation in the courts, and negotiation between Indigenous nations and the Crown. 

The Supreme Court of Canada's landmark ruling in *Delgamuukw* in 1997—building on the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and treaty rights in section 35 of the *Constitution Act, 1982*—laid much of the jurisprudential groundwork for the contemporary doctrine. But it was not until several years later, with the Court's decision in *Tsilhqot'in*, that a claim for recognition of Aboriginal title was successfully made out. In the intervening years, the Supreme Court also established the basis for the Crown's constitutional duty to consult with Indigenous communities where state action was contemplated that might infringe on Aboriginal title before it was proven in court.

The contemporary doctrine of common law Aboriginal title is complex—made even more so by the web of legal and political relationships that form the importance context in which critical issues around the doctrine must be addressed. Our goal this week is the understand the crucial elements of this doctrine that build on material we have developed through our course and to identify key unanswered questions for this area of law going forward.
