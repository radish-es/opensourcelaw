For our penultimate class this term, we will use our time in class to do a help you identify key gaps in your knowledge and understanding in advance of the Winter exam. To that end, I have provided a list of "rapid review" questions for you to read and consider. I don’t suggest that you address them all in full detail. Instead, read each and consider your answer for no more than a minute or two. You can come back to these questions in more detail as part of your exam preparation--their purpose at this point is only to provide a check on what you've learned so far and to help you to discover where you can most effectively focus your studying.

### [Unit 1 (Weeks 2 and 3): Patterns of Common Law Argument](../week2)

- Why do we read *Harrison v Carswell* and *Moore v Regents of the University of California* as the first two cases in our course? 

- How would you summarize the two main argument pairs in *Harrison v Carswell*? Do we see these argument pairs recur anywhere in *Moore*? In any other cases this term?

- Use the reasoning in *Moore* to illustrate and explain the three key assumptions about the relationship between law and the economy (natural, neutral, necessary).

### [Week 4: Possession I](../week4)

- How does Locke say that one comes to own a wild acorn? Do his ideas help the judges in *Clift v Kane* to resolve the question of who owns the wild seals? 

- How do the preferred principles of first possession concerning seal pelts differ between the majority and minority decision in *Clift v Kane*? 

- Explain the differing approaches to precedent taken by the judges in *Clift v Kane*. How do these differing approaches relate to the judges' conclusions? 

- What does one need to do in order to abandon property? 

### [Week 5: Possession II](../week5)

- How can the three themes of colonialism in property law help us to understand the influence of Locke's *Second Treatise* on the judgments in *St. Catherine's Milling*?

- Is the Royal Proclamation of 1763 a source of Aboriginal title according to the doctrine developed in *St. Catherine's Milling*? 

- According to the courts in *St. Catherine's Millling*, is Aboriginal title a "beneficial interest" land? 

- Why is it significant that the courts in *St. Catherine's Milling* assume Aboriginal title is a "private" rather than "public" interest? 

### [Week 6: Possession III](../week6)

- Discuss the role of the land titles clarification process as a response to the history of land-based anti-Black racism in Nova Scotia.

- Using the facts of *Asher v Whitlock*, explain what it means to say that "ownership" at common law is *relative*.

- According to the doctrine in *Piper v Stevenson*, how does constructing a fence benefit an adverse possessor's claim? What else is required? 

### [Week 7: Exclusion I](../week7)

- How do the courts in *Canadian Copper Co.* and *Canadian Paper Co.* apply to the *Shelfer* test to resolve the question of the appropriate remedy in nuisance?

- How do the judges in *Canadian Copper Co.* and *Canadian Paper Co.* characterize the nuisances at issue as "natural" or "unnatural"? How does this characterization influence their decisions?

- How do Justice Idington in *Canadian Paper Co.* and Justice Middleton in *Canadian Copper Co.* differ in their understanding of "relevant" evidence? Are their approaches to this evidence both consistent with the classical style? 

### [Week 8: Exclusion II](../week8)

- When do riparian owners in Canada hold common law property rights in rivers and streams? 

- How does Locke's theory of property influence judicial reasoning in *McLaren v Caldwell*? 

- What is the principle of statutory interpretation applied by the Supreme Court of Canada in *McLaren v Caldwell*? How does this principle help the court to resolve the question of constructive expropriation in the case? 

- What can the *McLaren v Caldwell* case and surrounding legal developments tell us about arguments over the institutional role of courts versus legislatures in *Harrison v Carswell* and *Moore v Regents of the University of California*? 

### [Week 9: Exit I](../week9)

- What is the function of the doctrine of estates and how does that function relate to the fundamental dilemma of legal liberalism we have studied this term? 

- Compare the common law's approach to restraints on alienation as applied to the fee simple estate and to Aboriginal title.

- How would you interpret the following clause in a will: "To my daughter and her heirs, then to my nephew and his heirs."

- Describe the influence of the classical legal style on the following statement by Justice Mills in *Blackburn v McCallum*: "It is reasonable to say that where an estate is bestowed, of which the power of alienation is an incident, that one conveying such an estate to another shall not have the power to alter its character, and to make it something wholly different from what it has been made by the law. To do so is to assume the power to make an estate unknown to the law. It is an attempt not simply to convey away an estate, but to exercise a legislative power, and to create a new form of property in land."
