Over the past few weeks, we have studied the special role that common law property affords to possession and we have examined how possession relates to legal title. In the case of "unowned" things--like the wild seals we studied in *Clift v Kane*--showing physical control (plus an intention to control) amounts not only to a set of temporary rights, but to durable title as legally-recognized ownership—at least, if the animal can no longer "escape". Exactly *how* one can establish sufficient control is, as we saw, often difficult to define and heavily dependent on the circumstances. 

Last week, we turned our attention more squarely to possession and title in land in the context of common law Aboriginal title. Recalling that Locke applied his labour theory of first possession equally to personal and real property (i.e., to "things" and "land"), we saw how the application of that principle was denied to Indigenous peoples as the original inhabitants of present-day North America by the courts, who characterized their relationship to land as a "personal and usufructuary right".

This week, we continue to build our understanding of the relationship between possession and title that is so foundational to common law property. Our overarching question in Week 6 is as follows:

*Why* is title in land--as distinguished from possession of land--important? What are the justifications and consequences of the move from possession to title as part of the basic structure of a liberal market economy?

We start by taking up this question in a particular place and context: recent movements to "clarify" land titles in African Nova Scotian communities as a means to address economic disadvantage and an unequal distribution of land as a consequence of discriminatory land policies in the province. These movements have placed heavy emphasis on the regularization and formalization of land titles for individuals and families who have long been in possession of land, and can help us to understand--and develop a critical perspective on--the social and economic role of legal title.

 With this case study and the questions it raises in mind, we then move on to two crucial doctrinal points. The first of these addresses the fundamentally *relative* nature of possession and the legal rights and entitlements afforded to those in possession but who lack formal title. The second returns to Locke's idea of possession as the root of title in land in the context of a doctrine called *adverse possession*, on the basis of which a person in possession might be able to show superior rights to the party who holds formal title.
