Last week, we looked at the privileged place of *possession* in common law thinking about property. Stretching back to [the writings of John Locke on liberal political theory](../week4/#Locke), we saw that labour and possession have long provided an answer to the question of where property rights come from. *Possession*, in other words, can serve as the basis for *title*, the legal recognition of ownership. We also explored how possession, for all its seeming simplicity, can be a very difficult legal concept to interpret and apply in practice.

We now turn to the issue of *Aboriginal title* to further explore these topics of possession and title in the style of classical common law thought. Here, "Aboriginal title" refers to the common law doctrine that affords recognition to the property rights of Indigenous nations in land, based on their possession or occupancy of those lands prior to colonial settlement. For example, Mi'kmaw people have lived on and held established relationships with the lands in Mi'kmak'i for thousands of years. They did so long before colonial settlement and have never entered into a treaties "ceding" those lands to a colonial government. A Mi'kmaw community might, therefore, bring a case in the Canadian courts claiming recognition of their rights to their territorial lands. The legal framework for such cases have, to date, been established under the concept of common law Aboriginal title and it is this doctrine we will start to analyze this week.

However, before pursuing a better understanding of Aboriginal title and its historical development, it is important to be cautious about *[subsuming](../week1#three-themes-of-colonialism-in-law)* all relevant legal principles and legal systems within the common law doctrine. Mi'kmaw people not only occupied Mi'kma'ki long before colonization, they also governed their relationships with the land according to Mi'kmaw law. They continue to do so. Nevertheless, the Mi'kmaw Nation and other Indigenous nations are required, under Canadian law, to seek inter-legal recognition of their rights exclusively within the Canadian courts. Why--especially in context of the Peace and Friendship Treaties--should this be the case? 

We might interpret our focus in the course this week as addressing an "internal" perspective of the common law. What *is* the nature and source of Aboriginal title according to the common law's own logic? Going further to address the broader dynamic of subsummation requires an "external" perspective: from the standpoint of a relationship between nations that co-exist with one another, whose system of law can legitimately provide an answer questions about the content and source of Indigenous land rights? This external perspective is related to issues of sovereignty (how and when law-making authority is asserted as between nations) and to issues about how to understand the role of relationships, obligations and world views in a multi-juridical context.

We begin with the *Royal Proclamation of 1763*—a document in which King George III of England set out the terms of colonial settlement in British North America after the Seven Years War. In doing so, the British Crown articulated its contemporary interpretation of Aboriginal title and laid the groundwork for subsequent development of that doctrine in the common law courts. The Royal Proclamation of 1763 includes several key ideas that come to play a pivotal role in future cases. Among these are the assertion or assumption of sovereignty in the British Crown, the acknowledgement of Indigenous land rights in land "not having been ceded to or purchased", and a direct prohibition on the private sale and purchase of Indigenous land rights (otherwise referred to as a "restraint on alienation" via the doctrine of preemption). 

This week's materials are entitled "Possession II", but in fact the central lesson this week is about how the doctrine of Aboriginal title came to undermine Indigenous nations' own relationships to land while at the same time denying them "possession" of their territories as a basis for holding recognized property rights. When we read Locke's *Second Treatise* last week, we observed how his labour theory of property acknowledged the possibility of Indigenous peoples' property rights through possession (at least, with respect to wild animals or other "natural resources"), while simultaneously denying the relevance of Indigenous legal orders or ways of life for establishing such entitlements. Pay close attention to the role of that same reasoning in the materials you will read this week. 

These issues relate directly to the Royal Proclamation, 1763, which we turn to next. A crucial question for the courts in the *St. Catherine's Milling* case, below, and in subsequent decisions is about the nature and source of Aboriginal title. Was the Royal Proclamation to be understood as the *source* of Aboriginal title, or as a recognition of pre-existing rights? If the latter, where else might these rights find their source?
