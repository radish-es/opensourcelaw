Having now studied the roles of *possession* and *exclusion* in common law property, this week we move on to examine the context of *exit*--that is, how it is that owners extract themselves from property relations. Central to this context is the right to *alienate* property and the power of owners to place restrictions on alienability. Recall that we have already encountered alienation and restraints on alienation in the context of Aboriginal title going back to the [Royal Proclamation in 1763](../week5/#Royal%20Proclamation). As we learn this week, the extent to which landowners can and should be able transfer their property rights to others and to place limits on alienation has long raised some pervasive controversies in common law property.

As you will see from *Blackburn v McCallum* and *Re Walker*, below, courts often place a heavy emphasis on the free alienability of land. Any attempts to restrict free alienability are viewed with considerable skepticism in the classical style—consistent with the liberal ideal that property rights should support individuals to pursue their own ends. For example, in both *Blackburn* and *Walker*, the courts scrutinize clauses in a will that purport to limit how or when beneficiaries under that will can transfer the property interests they receive. This emphasis on free alienability has also become crucial for modern understandings of property as the basis for a liberal market economy. 

In order to understand the controversies around alienability in *Blackburn* and *Walker*, we will first need some background on the doctrines of tenure and estates. This is a big and reasonably complex topic that we will return to again next term. To start, the excerpt below offers a historical overview of tenure and estates and explains how these concepts became central to the structure of common law property in land. We will then cover the basic elements of common law estates and practice identifying key interests. These topics will provide the foundation for understanding issues of alienability in the cases that follow.
