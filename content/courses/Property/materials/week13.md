This week we continue our study of issues related to land use control from the perspective of the modern style. Our topic this week is the **acquired rights** of landowners under changing land use planning and zoning regimes.

- Acquired rights are property rights "acquired" by landowners through **actual use** of their land.

- Acquired rights are also called **non-conforming uses** in common law jurisdictions (or more colloquially, "grandfathered uses").

**Why it matters**: Acquired rights give landowners the right to continue pre-existing uses even when land use regulations change. They provide powerful protections for traditional property rights or big impediments to comprehensive planning and development (depending on your perspective).

**Where we're headed:** We will address questions about (1) the source and (2) scope of acquired rights and see how judicial reasoning in the modern style extends the themes we saw in the *de facto* expropriation cases.

- We'll also touch briefly on the issue of extinguishing acquired rights.

**Modernizing nuisance**: like *de facto* expropriation, the doctrine of acquired rights gained attention as local and provincial land use laws supplanted nuisance as the main legal tools to address land use disputes.

- Back in [Week 7](../week7) we looked at remedies in nuisance as a response to the basic liberal dilemma: neighbouring landowners each want full freedom of property, but the unrestricted freedom of one is impossible without limiting the other.

- At the time of *Canadian Copper Co.* and *Canadian Paper Co.*, nuisance claims were the main legal tool for regulating land use conflicts.

- But as these conflicts became more complex and widespread--with growing industrialization and urbanization--local planning regimes were enacted to separate clashing uses by confining them to different **zones** (residential uses over here, industrial uses over there). 

**Link to last week**: acquired rights help to soften the stringency of Canadian law on *de facto* expropriation.

- We saw in *Mariner* that the emerging test for *de facto* expropriation was hard for landowners to meet.

- Per Justice Binnie in  *Saint-Romuald (City) v Olivier*, below:  "[t]o counter the concern about confiscation without compensation, lawful existing uses came to be protected under the concept of acquired rights."

- More broadly, acquired rights help to shield landowners from some of dynamic uncertainties of modern planning.

Acquired rights were initially an invention of the courts, though today they are often enshrined in local legislation.
