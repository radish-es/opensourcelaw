In our last unit (Weeks 1-3), we looked at the "vocabulary" of common law legal arguments—the lexicon of typical, patterned argument types used by judges and lawyers to debate and reason through the merits of a case. At the end of Week 3, our discussion of this common law vocabulary left us with a nagging question: *how can arguments with this structure ever help us to resolve a case, to decide which judgement is more convincing or persuasive?* If every argument has one or more predictable counter-arguments, how does one side ever "win out" over the other?

From a historical perspective, the answer to this question depends--in part--on *when* we are asking it. For most of the remainder of this course, we will look at two contrasting styles of legal thought. Following legal scholars in the critical tradition, we will calls these ***classical*** and ***modern*** styles respectively.[^kennedy2002]  While legal arguments made in each of these styles share a basic structure or "grammar" that situates them in the common law tradition, they differ dramatically in terms of "style"—that is, how this basic grammar is employed and presented to persuade its audience.[^stein2018]

For our purposes, we'll simply call this basic grammar of the common law "liberalism". Liberalism can mean many things, but we will describe it as a structure for legal and political thought that rests on one basic dilemma:

#### The Basic Dilemma of Liberalism

As a structure of legal thought, liberalism holds that all human beings should be free to pursue their own ends and, in doing so, to compete with one another to pursue those ends. The dilemma of liberalism arises when we recognize that society can only benefit from free competition when it limits individual freedoms to some degree. In other words, individual freedom for any one person—as measured by the degree to which that person is free *from* societal control—is simply impossible without putting societal limits on the freedoms of everyone else.

Common law judges and lawyers have, historically, tried to "resolve" the dilemma of liberalism in different ways. The two styles of common law we will explore in this course--classical and modern--are defined by their different approaches to this basic dilemma. In particular, we can use the following three questions to identify and explore which style(s) is/are operating in a given case or context:[^stein2018]

#### Three Questions of Common Law Style

1. **Competition vs Control**: which "side" of the basic liberal dilemma does the judge or jurist emphasize, prioritize or privileged--free competition or societal limitations on that freedom?

2. **Public vs Private**: to what extent are the "public" and "private" spheres treated as separate and distinct? Does the the line between these spheres appear clear and sharp, or blurred (maybe even erased)? 

3. **Formalist vs Functionalist**: by what process does the common law develop, i.e. how is law made? Is law "discovered" from settled principles or "determined" according to its capacity to meet social/political/economic circumstances? 

We will use these three questions throughout the course to study the different ways that classical and modern styles of thought manifest in judicial decisions and other sources of property law.

We can trace much of the roots of liberal legal thought to the work of John Locke in the late seventeenth century, especially his writing on the concept of *possession*. In the excerpt below, Locke addresses a core question at the heart of property law: *How does any individual, in society, come to "own" anything?*

As you read through the excerpt from Locke's *Second Treatise*, consider his answer to this question and its relationship to the basic dilemma of liberalism described above.
