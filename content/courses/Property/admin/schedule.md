This document contains the weekly class meeting schedule with a brief description of each weekly topic and a list of assigned readings for that week.

We will meet in Weldon Room 207 throughout the year. 

## Unit 1: Basics of Common Law Argument

### [Week 1 (Sept 12/14)](../../materials/week1)

**Introduction to the Course** - In our first week of class, we will cover course logistics, expectations and some core principles and practices for the year. We will then move on to look at the central framing question for the course. Finally, we will engage with the challenge of adopting an anti-colonial approach to learning and teaching property law. 

 ### [Week 2 (Sept 21)](../../materials/week2)

**Patterns of Common Law Argument I** - We will undertake multiple readings of our first case, *Harrison v Carswell* to gain some experience with the basic structure of common law arguments in terms of symmetric "argument pairs". *Harrison* is an ideal case to illustrate this structure of argument by two leading jurists on the Supreme Court. 

### [Week 3 (Sept 28)](../../materials/week3)

**Patterns of Common Law Argument II** - In this final week of Unit 1, we will continue to investigate patterns of common law argument in a second case: *Moore*. We continue to practice identifying the "argument pairs" that lie at the heart of common law reasoning and try to link these ot the *Harrison* case we read in Week 2. 

## Unit 2: Classical Common Law Thought

### [Week 4 (Oct 3/5)](../../materials/week4)

**Possession I** - This week, we begin to develop the historical thread of the course, starting with an introduction to the framework we will use to study property law as a aspect of political economy in Canada over the past few hundred years. Starting in the classical style of common law thought, we will read some of the liberal beginnings of possession in Locke and see their application to the seal fishery in Newfoundland in *Clift v Kane*.

### [Week 5 (Oct 17/19)](../../materials/week5)

**Possession II** - In this portion of the course, we explore some of the bases of Aboriginal title and look at how common law courts in the classical mode interpreted Indigenous land rights. This week also introduces the distinction between different forms of title. 

### [Week 6 (Oct 24/26)](../../materials/week6)

**Possession III** - Building on our discussion of possession and title so far, we take up a case study of unclear land titles in African Nova Scotian communities. This case study will help us to understand some of the rationales offered for the formalization of titled based on possession and introduce a critical perspective on the issues. Based on the case study, we will then explore some of the further background common law doctrine on the relative nature of possession and claims to adverse possession. 

### [Week 7 (Nov 1/3)](../../materials/week7)

**Exclusion I** - The course now moves away from a focus on possession and into one of the key "sticks" in the common law ownership bundle: the right to exclude. Our entry point in the law of nuisance, and specifically the question of remedy (injunction vs damages). 

### [Week 8 (Nov 14/16)](../../materials/week8)

**Exclusion II** - Our second set of topics on exclusion concerns the right to exclude the *state* (or other private parties under state sanction). This week we introduce the concept of "expropriation" (also called *eminent domain*) and the ways in which courts from a classical perspective approached cases where governments "infringed" or took away private rights without paying owners compensation. 

### [Week 9 (Nov 21/Nov 23)](../../materials/week9)

**Exit I** - This week we turn our attention to the right to alienate (sell or other transfer) property and the degree to which restraints on alienation have been permitted or prohibited by common law courts. 

### [Week 10 (Nov 30)](../../materials/week10)

**Review** - We'll address a series of "rapid review" questions to help you identify gaps and areas of focus to plan your studying for the Winter exam.

### [Week 11 (Dec 5)](../../materials/week11)

**Treaties** - In this final class of the term we will circle back to core questions of the relationship between land and property through the lens of the Peace & Friendship Treaties. 

## Unit 3: Modern Common Law Thought

### [Week 12 (Jan 9/Jan 11)](../../materials/week12)

**Land Use Control I** - In our first class on the modern style of common law thought, we will return to the issue of expropriation to examine how the Canadian law on *de facto* takings emerged and developed. We will use the recent controversy around the Blue Mountain-Birch Cove Wilderness area in Halifax to ground our study of the legal issues and context. 

### [Week 13 (Jan 16/18)](../../materials/week13)

**Land Use Control II** - We continue to look at questions of land use control, this week from the perspective of the doctrine of *acquired rights*. The materials explore the question of whether acquired rights come from, and whether and how their scope can change over time.


### [Week 14 (Jan 23/25)](../../materials/week14)

**The Right to Shelter** - The right to shelter is an emerging constitutional right in Canada protected under section 7 of the *Charter*. It is a right that continues to evolve rapidly, alongside growing numbers of people experiencing chronic homelessness in Canadian cities. The ways in which the courts have constructed the right to shelter on an empirical basis linked to the availability of shelter options and the degree to which they have considered the needs and choices of unhoused persons raises key questions about how the right to shelter has be shaped in the modern style.

### [Week 15 (Jan 30/Feb1)](../../materials/week15)

**Restrictive Covenants** - This week we look an another important dimensions of local land use controlâ€”this type from the perspective of "private" planning instruments in the form of restrictive covenants. We look at key requirements for creating valid covenant, and then turn to the common law's troubled history of using discriminatory covenants to exclude certain groups and the courts' use of the public policy doctrine as a response.

### [Week 16 (Feb 6/8)](../../materials/week16)

**Qualified Interests** - This week, we return to the doctrine of estates introduced in Week 10. Based on this prior material, we extend our terminology to classify and understand the different types of interests that may be created by *inter vivos* transfer or testamentary bequest. These aspects will then lead us back to our study of the public policy doctrine and its application to qualified interests. 

<!--

### [Week 16 (Feb 16)](../../readings/week16)

**Review** - A chance to pause the introduction of new material and review what we have covered so far in Unit 3.

### [Week 17 (Mar 2)](../../readings/week17)

**Reserve Lands** - This week we return to the materials on Indigenous land rights from Unit 2, picking up on the development of the doctrine of Aboriginal title and examining the specific structure and challenges associated with Indigenous peoples' property rights in reserve lands. 

## Unit 4: Contemporary Common Law Thought

### [Week 18 (Mar 9)](../../readings/week18)

**Back to Possession** - In order to introduce our final unit and the contemporary style of common law thought, we review the law on possession of both things and land and study its application in two recent cases.
