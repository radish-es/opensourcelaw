!!TEST ADDITION!!

For first-year law students, property law can be a kaleidoscopic subject: fragmentary, blinkered, sometimes disorienting. Property spans multiple legal traditions and offers up a disorderly patchwork of principles, rules and norms. It is full of apparent contradictions. 

The are many possible ways to teach and learn about property, to make sense of and bring some order within the kaleidoscope. In this course, we will take a critical historical approach that may look different from your other first-year courses. More specifically, we will use the following question about law, history and political economy to thread the material together:

> *How have legal rules about property produced Canada's liberal market economy over the past few hundred years and who benefits from the result?* 

In other words, we will take a social concept—*the market*—and try to develop a story about how law has realized one actual and particular version of that concept over time in the Canadian context.

That Canada has a certain kind of market economy, along with that economy's particular distribution of benefits and burdens, is not predestined. Nor is it an accident. Legal rules—property foremost among them—are the product of choices that create background conditions for both market exchange and its regulation by the state. By taking a critical look at those choices and what constrains them, we have a better chance of understanding our current economic conditions and their potential for change. 

These are big ideas and I will have much more to say about this overarching frame in a few weeks. For now, simply be aware that such a frame exists and that we will return to it as a touchstone again and again throughout the course. 

## Course Syllabus ##

Before you start to read the course materials, please familiarize yourself with the procedures and expectations for our course this year. Start by reading the [Course Syllabus](../../admin/syllabus) and reviewing the [Course Schedule](../../admin/schedule). These are the key documents you'll need to use throughout the year to understand the course logistics, expectations, policies and schedule for assigned readings.

Ensure that you begin this week with a good understanding of:

- [Course procedures](../../admin/syllabus#general-information) for communicating with me and arranging appointments outside of class meetings;

- How to access the [course website and assigned materials](../../admin/syllabus#course-website-and-course-materials);

- [Goals and expectations](../../admin/syllabus#course-goals-and-expectations) for class preparation and participation in class meetings;

- How you will be [evaluated](../../admin/syllabus#evaluation) in the course; and

- Your rights and responsibilities related to [accommodations, plagiarism and maintaining an inclusive classroom](../../admin/syllabus#accommodations).

I will highlight some key points from these materials at the beginning of this week's class meeting and make time for your questions about the syllabus. If questions arise as you read the syllabus for the first time, you can submit them to me (anonymously) ahead of time using the form below.

## Learning in Mi'kmaw Territory ##

Our class meetings take place in Mi'kmaw territory, and a big part of our course will be about laws that govern or otherwise affect Indigenous lands. 

Many of you will be familiar with the concept of a *land acknowledgement* — the practice of acknowledging the Indigenous territory on which a class, event or meeting is taking place and recognizing or reaffirming the treaty relationships in that territory. A land acknowledgement often used at Dalhousie looks similar to or builds on this statement:

> *Dalhousie University is located in Mi'kma'ki, the ancestral and unceded territory of the Mi'kmaq. We are all Treaty people.*

Statements like these play a crucial role in building awareness and renewing ongoing relationships between settler and Indigenous communities. They are especially important for our course, where we will aim for a deeper understanding of legal concepts like "unceded territory" and "Treaty".

One challenge associated with land acknowledgements is that they do not always give the impression of being meaningful or genuine—especially if they come across as formulaic or fail to address the ongoing injustices faced by Indigenous people. That is not a criticism of the practice of land acknowledgements—it is motivation to reflect on the question: *what does acknowledging Mi'kmaw territory mean to you?*

The following exercise is adapted from an excellent open resource on land acknowledgements in the context of business relationships: *[Building Relationships with Business Communication](https://caul-cbua.pressbooks.pub/businesscommunication/chapter/indigenous-land-acknowledgments/)* by Linda Macdonald.

### Draft a Land Acknowledgement

<iframe src="https://native-land.ca/wp-content/themes/Native-Land-Theme/embed/embed.html?maps=territories,treaties&name=mi-kmaq" height="400" width="400"></iframe>

Beginning in 1725, the Mi'kmaq and British entered into and periodically renewed a series of nation-to-nation agreements—treaties—that are still in force today. We will look at these treaty relationships in detail in Week 7. This week we want to highlight one aspect of how these treaty relationships have been interpreted—namely that, in entering these relationships, the Mi'kmaq did not agreed or purport to give up, sell or otherwise "cede" their legal authority over or rights in their lands.

As individuals, you likely come to this course with a range of different understandings and experiences about what else these treaty relationships mean and how they do or should impact your lives. One way to build and communicate this understanding is to try to create your own land acknowledgement. 

**In a few sentences (no more than a paragraph), draft a land acknowledgement that you might use to introduce a meeting or presentation at the law school.** As you do so, consider the following questions:

- What are the purposes and functions of this land acknowledgement? What do you hope to achieve with it?

- What questions does the process of drafting this land acknowledgement raise for you? What more do you want or need to learn about the relationships that underpin this acknowledgement?

- Sometimes a land acknowledgement contains a statement "welcoming" participants to the territory. When might such a statement be appropriate or inappropriate?

Please bring your written acknowledgement to our first class — we will take some time to discuss these together.

## "Law" in this Course ##

Property law in Canada is comprised of multiple legal orders—Canada is a "multi-juridical" country. Those multiple orders include the Anglo-Canadian common law order, the Franco-Canadian civil law order, and the many diverse Indigenous legal orders that preceded colonial settlement by the British and French and which in many communities persist and continue to thrive. Indigenous legal orders are often not afforded the same respect as other legal orders by settlers and settler institutions, and they have been—in some cases continue to be—violently suppressed or ignored.

We will not study civil law in this course. We will address both common law (including common law doctrines *about* Indigenous peoples) and aspects of some Indigenous legal orders, as well as their points of intersection. We will also delve into general principles that recognize the legal authority of Indigenous nations and their inherent right to self-governance. 

It is important to acknowledge, however, that most of the material we read and analyze in the course is based in the Anglo-Canadian common law tradition. We will aim to be careful to recognize when and how that emphasis risks—even implicitly—reinforcing certain stereotypes about what counts as law and legal reasoning, and we will try to ask the critical question of how the course might better reflect Canada as a multi-juridical country.

### A Note on Terminology

I will try to use the general term "law" in this course to mean any operative system of law but not to refer to any particular legal tradition, as in "law helps us to resolve our disputes and live together in a political community." When talking about a specific legal tradition I will try to label it with as much detail as possible, e.g. "(Anglo-Canadian) common law", "Mi'kmaw law". This practice will aim to reinforce the point that, while these legal orders may look different, they should each be afforded respect and critical attention.

## Patterns of Common Law Argument ##

In our first unit of the course, [Weeks 1 to 3,](../../admin/schedule) we will begin to examine certain patterns of common law legal arguments. By this I mean the expected patterns of argument and counter-argument that we tend to get from common law lawyers and judges in courtroom settings, legal decisions, lawyers' briefs and the like. As we will see, these patterns are the basic building blocks of legal argument in the common law tradition and, once you learn to recognize them, you will see that they tend to repeat and reproduce themselves again and again, in case after case.

But before we begin to study the arguments that common law lawyers and judges make, I would like you to think about what kinds of everyday arguments *you* would make or expect to see when confronted with a problem about property. By starting here, we will be able to see some of the similarities and differences between the patterns arguments typically made by lawyers and by non-lawyers.

### Property in Your Cells

![](/media/hela_cells02.jpg)

Various legal rules aim to protect a person's bodily integrity. But in some cases, a person's biological cells might be removed from their body. Consider the following question:

> *Should people continue to have ownership of their biological cells once those cells are removed from their body?*

Listen to the *Radiolab* podcast below as you think about how you would answer this question and the *arguments* you would use to support that answer. You may also want to think about how you would define "ownership" in this context.

Write down your answer and bring it to class.

We will discuss your answers when we meet this week, but we won't look at a "legal" answer to this problem just yet. Instead, for the remainder of this week and next, we will develop a method for identifying common patterns of legal argument. We'll return to the problem of property in human cells and practice applying this method in Week 3.

### Pause!

Normally, I suggested that you read the full material for each week before attending the first class for that week. Week 1 is an exception. I suggest that you pause here, and return to the next section after our first class meeting (but before the second meeting).

## Reading Our First Case ##

The first case we’ll read in this course — the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in *Harrison v Carswell* — is about a labour dispute at a shopping mall in Winnipeg in the mid-1970s. That setting may not strike you as obviously important or exciting, but *Harrison* is arguably one of the Supreme Court's most important decisions for what it reveals about the central problems and debates in property law, and — more important still — for what it shows us about *how* judges and lawyers engage in those debates using the patterns and practices of common law legal argument.

There are several layers here that we will peel away in order to fully appreciate *Harrison*. We will undertake this project one step at a time, and I will ask you to read the case more than once — from a few different perspectives — over the next two weeks. 

Before you jump into the case as a whole, watch the short screencast below to start building a few essential strategies for reading *Harrison* and other complex cases in our course.

### Exercise: Quick Case Review

A simple strategy for quickly reviewing a case:

1. Read the facts closely.

2. Skip ahead to find out where each judge lands in their final decision.

3. Work through the case text in detail, paragraph by paragraph, stopping at after each main point or issue to reflect on what you've learned.

Once you've completed the quiz above, move on to step 3 of the case review strategy: read the full case as closely as possible. You will likely find some terms and concepts a little confusing; others you might find totally incomprehensible. This is completely normal. Try not to get too discouraged if you find that reading cases is frustrating at first. Keep going — this will get easier as you practice, even if it feels like treading water for now. I encourage you to take the case in chunks, using the prompts along the way to pause your reading and take stock of what you're learning or finding it hard to understand.

**Dickson J.** (Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, and de Grandpré JJ. concurring) —

[1] The respondent, Sophie Carswell, was charged under *The Petty Trespasses Act*, R.S.M. 1970, c. P50, with four offences (one on each of four days) of unlawfully trespassing upon the premises of the Fairview Corporation Limited, trading under the firm name and style of Polo Park Shopping Centre, located in the City of Winnipeg, after having been requested by the owner not to enter on or come upon the premises. The appellant, Peter Harrison, manager of Polo Park Shopping Centre, swore the informations. The charges were dismissed by the Provincial Judge but on a trial de novo in the County Court Mrs. Carswell was convicted and fined $10 on each of the charges. The convictions were set aside by the Manitoba Court of Appeal [1974] 4 W.W.R. 394 (Freedman C.J.M. and Matas J.A., with Guy J.A. dissenting) and the present appeal followed by leave of this Court.

{{< spoiler text="Justice Dickson's first group of arguments: applying past cases." >}}After briefly reciting the key facts (as he sees them), Justice Dickson jumps right into his first group of arguments in favour of upholding the charges in trespass against Sophie Carswell.

The focus of Justice Dickson's arguments here is an earlier case decided by the Supreme Court called *Peters v the Queen*, which had some very similar facts to the current dispute. As you read paragraphs [2] to [8], consider: **Why does Justice Dickson bring up the *Peters* case here? How does *Peters* support his preferred outcome in the current case?**{{< /spoiler >}}

[2] With great respect, I am unable to agree with the majority reasons, delivered in the Court of Appeal by Freedman C.J.M., for I find it difficult, indeed impossible, to make any well-founded distinction between this case and *Peters v. The Queen* (1971), 2 C.C.C. (2d) 339n, 17 D.L.R. (3d) 128, decided by this Court four years ago in a unanimous decision of the full bench. The constitutional issue raised in *Peters* no longer concerns us; the only other issue was whether the owner of a shopping plaza had sufficient control or possession of the common areas, having regard to the unrestricted invitation to the public to enter upon the premises, as to enable it to invoke the remedy of trespass. The Court decided it did. That case and the present case came to us on much the same facts; picketing within a shopping centre in connection with a labour dispute. In *Peters* the picketing was carried out by the president of the Brampton Labour Council and seven other persons, carrying placards and distributing leaflets in front of a Safeway store, seeking a boycott of Safeway for selling California grapes. In the present case the picketing was carried out by Mrs. Carswell and 11 other persons carrying placards and distributing leaflets in front of the premises of their employer, Dominion Stores. In both instances the picketing was peaceful. Although the question posed in *Peters* did not recite the facts upon which the case rested, the question was worded thus:

> Did the learned Judges in Appeal err in law in determining that *the* owner of *the* property had sufficient possession of *the* shopping plaza sidewalk to be capable of availing itself of the remedy for trespass under The Petty Trespass Act, R.S.O. 1960, Chapter 294, Section 1(1)? (The italics are mine.)

[3] In my view it is so expressed, with repeated use of the definite article, as to relate the question to the circumstances in respect of which the Judges made their determination.

[4] The judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in *Peters*, [1971] 1 O.R. 597, 2 C.C.C. (2d) 336, 16 D.L.R. (3d) 143:

> With respect to the first ground of appeal, it is our opinion that an owner who has granted a right of entry to a particular class of the public has not thereby relinquished his or its right to withdraw its invitation to the general public or any particular member thereof, and that if a member of the public whose invitation to enter has been withdrawn refuses to leave, he thereby becomes a trespasser and may be prosecuted under the *Petty Trespass Act* [R.S.O. 1960, c. 294 (now R.S.O. 1970, c. 347)]. Here, the invitation extended by the owner was of a general nature and included tenants, employees, agents and all persons having or seeking business relations with the tenants. However, notwithstanding the general nature of the invitation, the owner did not thereby lose its right to withdraw the invitation from the general public or any particular member thereof. In addition, it is also our view with respect to trespass that possession does not cease to be exclusive so long as there is the right to control entry of the general public, and here the owner had not relinquished that right of control.

[5] The brief judgment in this Court, answering in the negative the question asked, neither adopted nor repudiated the reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal but it should not be overlooked that when the *Peters* case was before the Ontario Court of Appeal, counsel for Peters relied upon the decision of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in *Grosvenor Park Shopping Centre Ltd. v. Waloshin* (1964), 49 W.W.R. 237, 46 D.L.R. (2d) 750. That case arose out of injunction proceedings during a strike of employees of Loblaw Groceterias Co. Ltd. in Saskatoon who were picketing with placards on the sidewalks adjacent to store premises located in a shopping centre. The pertinent part of the judgment of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal reads [p. 755]:

> Learned counsel for the appellant argued that the respondent did not have that degree of possession essential to an action in trespass.

> The area upon which it is alleged the appellants have trespassed is part of what is well known as a shopping centre. While legal title to the area is in the respondent, it admits in its pleadings that it has granted easements to the many tenants. The evidence also establishes that the respondent has extended an unrestricted invitation to the public to enter upon the premises. The very nature of the operation is one in which the respondent, both in its own interests and in the interests of its tenants, could not do otherwise. Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that the respondent is in actual possession. The most that can be said is that the respondent exercises control over the premises but does not exercise that control to the exclusion of other persons. For that reason, therefore, the respondent cannot maintain an action in trespass against the appellants: *vide* 38 Hals., 3rd ed., p. 743, para. 1212. Support, too, for this view may be found in *Zeller's (Western) Ltd. v. Retail Food & Drug Clerks Union, Local 1518* (1963), 45 W.W.R. 337, 42 D.L.R. (2d) 582 (B.C. C.A.).

[6] Gale C.J.O., in *Peters*, offered this observation with respect to *Grosvenor Park*, supra [p. 146]:

> The solicitor for the appellant relied very heavily upon a decision of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in *Grosvenor Park Shopping Centre Ltd. v. Waloshin* [supra]. If our view in this appeal does not harmonize with the reasoning of the Court in the *Grosvenor Park* case, we must respectfully disagree with that reasoning.

[7] So when the *Peters* case came to this Court for consideration the Court had before it the reasoning of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in that case and the reasoning, difficult to reconcile, of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in *Grosvenor Park*; the reasoning of the Ontario Court prevailed. There has been no suggestion that *Peters* was wrongly decided; therefore, I would think it must be regarded as controlling unless it can properly be distinguished from the case at bar. No distinction can be made on the ground of contract; there is a copy of the lease from Fairview to Dominion Stores among the papers but it would not appear, nor has it been argued, that any distinction can rest on that document. As to a possible statutory distinction, the Petty Trespass Acts of Manitoba and Ontario do not differ in any material respect and indeed s. 24 of The Labour Relations Act, 1972 (Man.), c. 75, specifically preserves rights against trespassers. Therefore it would seem that the appeal must succeed unless a valid distinction can be drawn on the ground that the president of the Brampton Labour Council in *Peters* was a mere member of the general public from whom permission to remain on the premises could be withdrawn at will, whereas Mrs. Carswell was an employee of one of the tenants of the shopping centre on strike in support of a current labour dispute from whom permission to remain on the premises could not, as a matter of law, be withdrawn. I find myself unable to accept that any ground in law supports such a distinction.

[8] The evidence discloses that distribution of pamphlets or leaflets in the mall of Polo Park Shopping Centre or on the parking lot has never been permitted by the management of the centre and that this prohibition has extended to tenants of the centre. The centre, as a matter of policy, has not permitted any person to walk in the mall carrying placards. There is nothing in the evidence supporting the view that in the present case the owner of the centre was acting out of caprice or whimsy or mala fides. In a comment entitled "Labour Law — Picketing on Shopping Centres" (1965), 43 Can. Bar Rev. 357 at 362, H. W. Arthurs referred to the following as one of the legitimate concerns of the landlord of a shopping centre:

> … while public authorities may, on behalf of the community, strike a reasonable balance between traffic and picketing on public sidewalks and streets, the shopping centre owner can hardly be expected to make such a choice; he has no authority to speak for the community; to grant picketing or parading privileges to all would invite chaos, while to do so selectively would invite commercial reprisals. He is thus driven to adopt a highly restrictive approach to granting permission to groups who wish to parade or picket in the shopping centre.

{{< spoiler text="Justice Dickson's second set of arguments: balancing interests." >}}To this point, Dickson has focused his attention on *Peters* as the key judicial precedent that resolves the current case. In paragraph [8], Justice Dickson dismisses any reasons for distinguishing this case from *Peters*: the mall’s rules against picketing and pamphleting were the same for members of the public and tenants of the mall, and the mall owner wasn’t acting capriciously or in bad faith against the picketers. Indeed, in Justice Dickson’s view, the mall owner was simply and quite legitimately acting in their own interests in governing the mall property. 

Next, beginning at paragraph [9], Justice Dickson flows—suddenly, but seamlessly—into a new set of arguments. Having identified the mall owner’s interests in governing the mall—namely, their economic interests in maintaining order and staying on good terms with the mall tenants—Justice Dickson is now engaging arguments about the further significance of those interests. Here, the question for Justice Dickson becomes whether or not the Court can and should balance the mall owner’s interests against those of Sophie Carswell and the other picketers in exercising their lawful labour rights. 

Notice that Justice Dickson never actually engages in such a balancing exercise—that is, he does not identify whose interests are more important here. Why not? What reasons does he offer for declining to weigh Carswell's interests against those of the mall owner?{{< /spoiler >}}

[9] It is urged on behalf of Mrs. Carswell that the right of a person to picket peacefully in support of a lawful strike is of greater social significance than the proprietary rights of an owner of a shopping centre and that the rights of the owner must yield to those of the picketer. The American example has been cited but I cannot say that I find the American cases to which we have been referred of great help. The facts in *Schwartz-Torrance Investment Corpn. v. Bakery and Confectionery Workers' Union, Local 31* (1964), 394 P. 2d 921, 85 S. Ct. 888, decided by the Supreme Court of California, are almost identical with those in *Grosvenor Park* but I think it not unimportant to note that in *Schwartz-Torrance* Tobriner J., early in his judgment, drew attention to the fact that the Legislature of the State of California had expressly declared that the public policy of the state favoured concerted activities of employees for the purpose of collective bargaining and had enacted the policy into an exception to the criminal trespass law. Construing that exception, the California Supreme Court in a case antedating *Schwartz-Torrance* had concluded that the Legislature, in dealing with trespasses, had specifically subordinated the rights of the property owner to those of persons engaged in lawful labour activities. *Schwartz-Torrance* is, therefore, of small aid in this case and indeed can be said to support, in a negative sense, a position inimical to that of Mrs. Carswell. And one need only read *Amalgamated Food Employees' Union, Local 590 v. Logan Valley Plaza Inc.* (1968), 391 U.S. 308, and then read *Lloyd Corpn. v. Tanner* (1972), 407 U.S. 551, 92 S. Ct. 2219, to apprehend the uncertainties and very real difficulties which emerge when a court essays to legislate as to what is and what is not a permissible activity within a shopping centre.



[10] The submission that this Court should weigh and determine the respective values to society of the right to property and the right to picket raises important and difficult political and socio-economic issues, the resolution of which must, by their very nature, be arbitrary and embody personal economic and social beliefs. It raises also fundamental questions as to the role of this Court under the Canadian constitution. The duty of the court, as I envisage it, is to proceed in the discharge of its adjudicative function in a reasoned way from principled decision and established concepts. I do not for a moment doubt the power of the court to act creatively --- it has done so on countless occasions; but manifestly one must ask: what are the limits of the judicial function? There are many and varied answers to this question. Holmes J. said in *Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen* (1917), 244 U.S. 205 at 221, 37 S. Ct. 524, 61 L. Ed. 1086.

> I recognize without hesitation that judges do and must legislate, but they can do it only interstitially; they are confined from molar to molecular actions.

[11] Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process (1921), p. 141, recognized that the freedom of the judge is not absolute in this expression of his view:

> The judge, even when he is free, is still not wholly free. He is not to innovate at pleasure. He is not a knight-errant, roaming at will in pursuit of his own ideal of beauty or of goodness. He is to draw his inspiration from consecrated principles.

[12] The former Chief Justice of the Australian High Court, Sir Owen Dixon, in an address delivered at Yale University in September 1955, "Concerning Judicial Method", had this to say:

> But in our Australian High Court we have had as yet no deliberate innovators bent on express change of acknowledged doctrine. It is one thing for a court to seek to extend the application of accepted principles to new cases or to reason from the more fundamental of settled legal principles to new conclusions or to decide that a category is not closed against unforeseen instances which in reason might be subsumed thereunder. It is an entirely different thing for a judge, who is discontented with a result held to flow from a long accepted legal principle, deliberately to abandon the principle in the name of justice or of social necessity or of social convenience. The former accords with the technique of the common law and amounts to no more than an enlightened application of modes of reasoning traditionally respected in the courts. It is a process by the repeated use of which the law is developed, is adapted to new conditions, and is improved in content. The latter means an abrupt and almost arbitrary change.

*(See also Jaffe, English and American Judges as Lawmakers (1969); McWhinney, Canadian Jurisprudence (1958), pp. 1-23; Friedmann, Law in a Changing Society, 2nd ed. (1972), pp. 49-90; and Allen, Law in the Making, 7th ed. (1964), pp. 302-11.)*

[13] Society has long since acknowledged that a public interest is served by permitting union members to bring economic pressure to bear upon their respective employers through peaceful picketing, but the right has been exercisable in some locations and not in others and to the extent that picketing has been permitted on private property the right hitherto has been accorded by statute. For example, s. 87 of The Labour Code of British Columbia, 1973 (2nd Sess.) (B.C.), c. 122, provides that no action lies in respect of picketing permitted under the Act for trespass to real property to which a member of the public ordinarily has access.

[14] Anglo-Canadian jurisprudence has traditionally recognized, as a fundamental freedom, the right of the individual to the enjoyment of property and the right not to be deprived thereof, or any interest therein, save by due process of law. The Legislature of Manitoba has declared in The Petty Trespasses Act that any person who trespasses upon land, the property of another, upon or through which he has been requested by the owner not to enter, is guilty of an offence. If there is to be any change in this statute law --- if A is to be given the right to enter and remain on the land of B against the will of B --- it would seem to me that such a change must be made by the enacting institution, the Legislature, which is representative of the people and designed to manifest the political will, and not by the court.

[15] I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba and restore the judgment of the County Court Judge.

**Laskin CJC.** (dissenting) (*Spence* and *Beetz JJ.* concurring) —

[16] I would be content to adopt the reasons of Freedman C.J.M. [1974] 4 W.W.R. 394 and, accordingly, to dismiss this appeal without more if I did not feel compelled, in view of the course of argument, to add some observations bearing on the decision of this Court in *Peters v. The Queen* (1971), 2 C.C.C. (2d) 339n, 17 D.L.R. (3d) 128, dismissing an appeal from the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal, [1971] 1 O.R. 597, 2 C.C.C. (2d) 336, 16 D.L.R. (3d) 143. The observations I am about to make about the *Peters* case carry into two areas of concern respecting the role of this Court as the final Court in this country in both civil and criminal causes. Those areas are, first, whether this Court must pay mechanical deference to stare decisis and, second, whether this Court has a balancing role to play, without yielding place to the Legislature, where an ancient doctrine, in this case trespass, is invoked in a new setting to suppress a lawful activity supported both by legislation and by a well-understood legislative policy.

{{< spoiler text="Introducing Chief Justice Laskin's responding arguments." >}}Like Justice Dickson, Chief Justice Laskin identifies *Peters* as the central focus of his arguments. Here, Laskin nicely maps his response, first, to Dickson's arguments about judicial precedent and, second, to the issue of balancing competing interests. 

Notice that Chief Justice Laskin is a master at framing these two issues in ways that presage and clearly favour the conclusions he wants to reach.
{{< /spoiler >}}

[17] The factual setting for these issues in the present case needs no great elaboration. The locale is a shopping centre in which a large number of tenants carry on a wide variety of businesses. The shopping centre has the usual public amenities such as access roads, parking lots and sidewalks which are open for use by members of the public who may or may not be buyers at the time they come to the shopping centre.

[18] There can be no doubt that at least where a shopping centre is freely accessible to the public, as is the one involved in the present case, the private owner has invested members of the public with a right of entry during the business hours of his tenants and with a right to remain there subject to lawful behaviour. Counsel for the appellant owner in this case stated that members of the public entered and remained in the shopping centre at the owner's whim, under what may be called a revocable licence, and were subject to liability for trespass if they did not leave when requested regardless of how proper their conduct was at the time. This is an extravagant position. It is a sufficient demonstration of its hollowness to point out that a member of the public who came to the shopping centre at the express invitation of a tenant for business reasons could not lawfully be excluded by the private owner. I need not pursue the extreme of the appellant's submission but put it to one side to deal with the specific trespass claim that arose here.

[19] An employee of a tenant in the shopping centre participated in a lawful strike and then proceeded to picket peacefully on the sidewalk in front of the tenant's premises. The struck employer took no action to prohibit the picketing and, on the record, an action by the employer would probably have been unsuccessful. The owner of the shopping centre introduced himself into the situation and told the picketer, the respondent in this appeal, that picketing was not permitted in any area of the shopping centre and if she did not leave she would be charged with trespass. He advised her to move to a public sidewalk which was some distance away. She continued to picket on the shopping centre sidewalk and charges against her under The Petty Trespasses Act, R.S.M. 1970, c. P50, followed.

{{< spoiler text="Chief Justice Laskin's view on applying past cases." >}}Laskin offers at least *four* distinctive arguments about why the Court's decision in *Peters* should not be determinative in this case. 

Can you identify one or more of these arguments in paragraphs [20] to [28]?{{< /spoiler >}}

[20] The *Peters* case, supra, also involved picketing in a shopping centre. However, the picketing there arose not out of a labour dispute with an employer tenant of premises in the shopping centre but was by way of a boycott appeal against the selling of California grapes. The oral reasons of Gale C.J.O. for the Ontario Court of Appeal were undoubtedly geared to the specific facts before him and it is therefore unfair, in my view, to read, without that context, his general statement that [p. 146]:

> … an owner who has granted a right of entry to a particular class of the public has not thereby relinquished his or its right to withdraw its invitation to the general public or any particular member thereof, and that if a member of the public whose invitation to enter has been withdrawn refuses to leave, he thereby becomes a trespasser and may be prosecuted under the *Petty Trespass Act* [R.S.O. 1960, c. 294].

[21] Be that as it may, the case came to the Supreme Court of Canada not at large but on two specific questions of law, the second of which concerned the constitutional validity of the provincial Petty Trespass Act, a matter which did not become an issue here. That was made clear to the sole intervenant in the present case, the Attorney General for Saskatchewan, who appeared to defend the validity of such legislation.

[22] The first question put to this Court in the *Peters* case was framed as follows:

> Did the learned Judges in appeal err in law in determining that the owner of the property had sufficient possession of the shopping plaza sidewalk to be capable of availing itself of the remedy for trespass under the Petty Trespass Act, section 1(1)?

[23] This question, a strictly legal one without any context of fact, was answered unanimously in the negative by the full Court of which I was a member. The Court gave the briefest of oral reasons and I regarded the answer as a response to a narrow question of whether a shopping centre owner can have sufficient possession of a sidewalk therein to support a charge of trespass under the provincial Act. The question, to me, was whether the owner had divested itself of possession so as to make the shopping centre sidewalk a public way upon which there could be no trespass as against such owner in any circumstances.

[24] It is, of course, open to others to read this Court's disposition of the *Peters* case differently but I can say for myself that the brief reasons would not have sufficed had the question that was asked been put in a factual frame as is often done when questions are formulated for the consideration of this Court. For me, it follows that the *Peters* case is neither in law nor in fact a controlling authority for the present case which came to this Court not upon specific questions of fact but at large so as to enable this Court to consider both law and fact as they bear on the position inter se of the shopping centre owner and of the lawful picketer in a legal strike.

[25] My brother Spence, who also sat as a member of this Court in the *Peters* case, associates himself with me in the view of it that I have put forward, and I would think that this should give pause to any suggestion that the *Peters* case has concluded the issue now before us, an issue arising on different facts and on a broader question of law than that to which an answer was sought and given in the *Peters* case.

[26] This Court, above all others in this country, cannot be simply mechanistic about previous decisions, whatever be the respect it would pay to such decisions. What we would be doing here, if we were to say that the *Peters* case, because it was so recently decided, has concluded the present case for us, would be to take merely one side of a debatable issue and say that it concludes the debate without the need to hear the other side.

[27] I do not have to call upon pronouncements of members of this Court that we are free to depart from previous decisions in order to support the pressing need to examine the present case on its merits. Pressing, because there are probably many hundreds of shopping centres in this country where similar issues have arisen and will arise. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has dealt with a picketing situation in a shopping centre in a different way than did the Ontario Court of Appeal in the *Peters* case, albeit on different facts and in respect of civil action rather than in a penal proceeding: see *Grosvenor Park Shopping Centre Ltd. v. Waloshin* (1964), 49 W.W.R. 237, 46 D.L.R. (2d) 750 (Sask. C.A.). There are judgments in related cases, that were cited to us in argument, that need to be taken into consideration in order to enable this Court to begin to draw lines which courts are habitually called upon to do. There should be, at least, some indication that the Court has addressed itself to the difficult issues that reside in the competing contentions that were made in this case and to which I will refer later on in these reasons. But, above all, this Court has not shown itself to be timorous in tackling important issues where it could be said, with some justification, that an important consideration was absent from an earlier judgment, even a recent one, upon which reliance was placed to foreclose examination of a similar issue in a subsequent case.

[28] I refer to the judgment of this Court in *Augustine's Farm Dairy v. Milk Commn. of Ont.*, [1973] S.C.R. 131, as evidence of the approach which I think is compelled in the present case. Of course, it was a different case and turned on the neglect of this Court to consider earlier conflicting decisions when deciding the case that was pressed as an authority to conclude the decision in the *Augustine's Farm Dairy* care itself. What is important, however, is not whether we have a previous decision involving a "brown horse" by which to judge a pending appeal involving a "brown horse", but rather what were the principles and, indeed, the facts, upon which the previous case, now urged as conclusive, was decided. I need only add that there can be no doubt on the question whether the present case provides a developed set of facts that raise the important issues of law that require decision here. It certainly does.

{{< spoiler text="Chief Justice Laskin's view on balancing interests." >}}Having responded to Justice Dickson's arguments about applying *Peters*, the Chief Justice then moves on to Dickson's second set of arguments. Remember that Justice Dickson declined to engage in an attempt to balance the interests at stake. Clearly, Laskin thinks the Court should undertake such a balancing. 

How does Chief Justice Laskin define those competing interests in the final paragraphs of his judgement? What principle does he offer as a means to achieve an appropriate balance?{{< /spoiler >}}

[29] I come then to those issues, and they can only be understood if we look at the present case not only from the position asserted by the shopping centre owner but as well from the position asserted by the lawful picketer. An ancient legal concept, trespass, is urged here in all its pristine force by a shopping centre owner in respect of areas of the shopping centre which have been opened by him to public use, and necessarily so because of the commercial character of the enterprise based on tenancies by operators of a variety of businesses. To say in such circumstances that the shopping centre owner may, at his whim, order any member of the public out of the shopping centre on penalty or liability for trespass if he refuses to leave does not make sense if there is no proper reason in that member's conduct or activity to justify the order to leave.

[30] Trespass in its civil law sense, and in its penal sense too, connotes unjustified invasion of another's possession. Where a dwelling house is concerned, the privacy associated with that kind of land-holding makes any unjustified or unprivileged entry a trespass, technically so even if no damage occurs. A court however would be likely to award only nominal damages for mere unprivileged entry upon another's private premises where no injury occurs, and it is probable that the plaintiff would be ordered to pay costs for seeking empty vindication. If the trespasser refuses to leave when ordered, he could be forcibly removed but, more likely, the police would be called and the issue would be resolved at that point, or a basis for an action or for a penal charge would arise. In short, apart from privileged entry, a matter to which I will return in these reasons, there is a significant element of protection of privacy in resort to trespass to exclude or remove persons from private dwellings.

[31] The considerations which underlie the protection of private residences cannot apply to the same degree to a shopping centre in respect of its parking areas, roads and sidewalks. Those amenities are closer in character to public roads and sidewalks than to a private dwelling. All that can be urged from a theoretical point of view to assimilate them to private dwellings is to urge that if property is privately owned, no matter the use to which it is put, trespass is as appropriate in the one case as in the other and it does not matter that possession, the invasion of which is basic to trespass, is recognizable in the one case but not in the other. There is here, on this assimilation, a legal injury albeit no actual injury. This is a use of theory which does not square with economic or social fact under the circumstances of the present case.

[32] What does a shopping centre owner protect, for what invaded interest of his does he seek vindication in ousting members of the public from sidewalks and roadways and parking areas in the shopping centre? There is no challenge to his title and none to his possession nor to his privacy when members of the public use those amenities. Should he be allowed to choose what members of the public come into those areas when they have been opened to all without discrimination? Human rights legislation would prevent him from discriminating on account of race, colour or creed or national origin, but counsel for the appellant would have it that members of the public can otherwise be excluded or ordered to leave by mere whim. It is contended that it is unnecessary that there be a reason that can stand rational assessment. Disapproval of the owner, in assertion of a remote control over the "public" areas of the shopping centre, whether it be disapproval of picketing or disapproval of the wearing of hats or anything equally innocent, may be converted (so it is argued) into a basis of ouster of members of the public. Can the common law be so devoid of reason as to tolerate this kind of whimsy where public areas of a shopping centre are concerned?

[33] If it was necessary to categorize the legal situation which, in my view, arises upon the opening of a shopping centre, with public areas of the kind I have mentioned (at least where the opening is not accompanied by an announced limitation on the classes of public entrants), I would say that the members of the public are privileged visitors whose privilege is revocable only upon misbehaviour (and I need not spell out here what this embraces) or by reason of unlawful activity. Such a view reconciles both the interests of the shopping centre owner and of the members of the public, doing violence to neither and recognizing the mutual or reciprocal commercial interests of shopping centre owners, business tenants and members of the public upon which the shopping centre is based.

[34] The respondent picketer in the present case is entitled to the privilege of entry and to remain in the public areas to carry on as she did (without obstruction of the sidewalk or incommoding of others) as being not only a member of the public but being as well, in relation to her peaceful picketing, an employee involved in a labour dispute with a tenant of the shopping centre, and hence having an interest, sanctioned by the law, in pursuing legitimate claims against her employer through the peaceful picketing in furtherance of a lawful strike.

[35] The civil law doctrine of abusive exercise of rights provides, in my opinion, an apt analogue for the present case. I do not press it as having precise application, but insofar as it embraces a balancing of rights, a consideration of the relativity of rights involving advertence to social purpose as well as to personal advantage, it is the peaceful picketer who has cause for complaint against interference with her rather than the shopping centre owner having a legally cognizable complaint: see, generally, Gutteridge, "Abuse of Rights" (1933-35), 5 Camb. L.J. 22; Castel, The Civil Law System of the Province of Quebec (1962), pp. 409 ff. The shopping centre owner has no overriding or even co-equal interest to serve in intervening in the labour dispute and, if anything, is acting as surrogate of the struck tenant in a situation where the latter has not and probably could not claim redress or relief.

[36] It seems to me that the present case involves a search for an appropriate legal framework for new social facts which show up the inaptness of an old doctrine developed upon a completely different social foundation. The history of trespass indicates that its introduction as a private means of redress was directed to breaches of the peace or to acts likely to provoke such breaches. Its subsequent enlargement beyond these concerns does not mean that it must be taken as incapable of further adaptation but must be applied on what I can only characterize as a level of abstraction which ignores the facts. Neither logic nor experience (to borrow from Holmes' opening sentence in his classic The Common Law) supports such a conclusion.

[37] Recognition of the need for balancing the interests of the shopping centre owner with competing interests of members of the public when in or on the public areas of the shopping centre engaged courts in the United States a little earlier than it did the courts in this country. Making every allowance for any constitutional basis upon which courts there grappled with this problem, their analyses are helpful because they arise out of the same economic and social setting in which the problem arises here. Thus, there is emphasis on unrestricted access to shopping centres from public streets and on the fact that access by the public is the very reason for the existence of shopping centres; there is the comparison drawn between the public markets of long ago and the shopping centre as a modern market place; there is the appreciation that in the light of the interests involved there can be no solution to their reconciliation by positing a flat all or nothing approach. The cases in the United States, and I cite a few of them here without further elaboration, appear to me to reject the appellant's proposition that (as his counsel put it) "the issue is trespass, not picketing" because that, in my opinion, involves a predetermination without regard to the issues of fact: see *Schwartz-Torrance Investment Corpn. v. Bakery and Confectionary Workers' Union, Local 31* (1964), 394 P. 2nd 921, 85 S. Ct. 888; *Amalgamated Clothing Workers of Amer. v. Wonderland Shopping Centre Inc.* (1963), 122 N.W. 2d 785; *Amalgamated Food Employees' Union, Local 590 v. Logan Valley Plaza Inc.* (1968), 391 U.S. 308; *Lloyd Corpn. Ltd. v. Tanner* (1972), 407 U.S. 551, 92 S. Ct. 2219.

[38] A more appropriate approach, to which I adverted earlier, is to recognize a continuing privilege in using the areas of the shopping centre provided for public passage subject to limitations arising out of the nature of the activity thereon and to the object pursued thereby, and subject as well to a limitation against material damage. There is analogy in existing conceptions of privilege as an answer to intentional torts, such as trespass. The principle is expressed in Prosser on Torts, 4th ed. (1971), at p. 98, as follows:

> ‘Privilege' is the modern term applied to those considerations which avoid liability where it might otherwise follow. In its broader sense, it is applied to any immunity which prevents the existence of a tort; but in its more common usage, it signifies that the defendant has acted to further an interest of such social importance that it is entitled to protection, even at the expense of damage to the plaintiff. He is allowed freedom of action because his own interests, or those of the public require it, and social policy will best be served by permitting it. The boundaries of the privilege are marked out by current ideas of what will most effectively promote the general welfare.

> The question of 'privilege' arises almost exclusively in connection with intentional torts. Much the same considerations have weight in negligence cases, in determining whether the defendant's conduct is reasonable under the circumstances. Negligence, however, is a matter of risk and probability of harm; and where the likelihood of injury to the plaintiff is relatively slight, the defendant will necessarily be allowed greater latitude than where the harm is intended, or substantially certain to follow.

> As the defendant's interest gains weight in the scale of social values, his privilege becomes greater. It may be absolute, in the sense that there is immunity from all liability, regardless of the motive or purpose for which he acts. The acts of judicial officers, done under authority of law, for example, are absolutely privileged, even though malicious or corrupt. It may be conditioned upon a proper motive and reasonable behavior, as in the case of the privilege of self-defense. It may be limited, in the sense that the defendant may not be restrained in advance from acting, and is not liable for any mere technical tort, but is still liable for any substantial damage that he may cause. The sliding scale by which the law balances the interests of the parties to accomplish a social purpose is nowhere better illustrated than in the field of privilege.

[39] See also Bohlen, "Incomplete Privilege to Inflict Intentional Invasions of Interests of Property and Personality" (1926), 39 Harvard L.R. 307, where it is said at pp. 319-20:

> The liability for a harmless invasion of either an interest of personality or property is either punitive or compensatory. In so far as it is punitive, there is no reason why, if the good likely to result from an act is greater than the harm it is intended to cause, the actor should be punished either criminally by fine or imprisonment, or by damages, whether labelled punitive or not, imposed in a civil action. And clearly there is no more reason for imposing either punishment because the harm intended and done is a harmless invasion of a dignitary interest of personality rather than a harmless invasion of a similar interest of property.

[40] Illustrations were given during the course of argument of situations which might put the respondent's activity in a different light relative to the place of picketing and to the object of picketing and which, correlatively, might provide some redeeming interest of the shopping centre owner in exercising control over the public areas. The character of a shopping centre, such as the one involved here, is one thing, and the nature and place of activities carried on there are something else. I would agree that it does not follow that because unrestricted access is given to members of the public to certain areas of the shopping centre during business hours, those areas are available at all times during those hours and in all circumstances to any kind of peaceful activity by members of the public, regardless of the interest being prompted by that activity and regardless of the numbers of members of the public who are involved. The Court will draw lines here as it does in other branches of the law as may be appropriate in the light of the legal principle and particular facts. In the present case it is the respondent who has been injured rather than the shopping centre owner.

[41] I would dismiss the appeal.

## Why Are We Reading *Harrison*? ##

While fairly mundane on its facts, *Harrison v Carswell* is compelling because the issues and arguments seem to transcend those facts, speaking to much bigger questions about law and legal institutions. At this point, you might be wondering which judge — Dickson or Laskin — has marshalled the "better" set of arguments. Of course, Justice Dickson's reasoning wins out, insofar as the majority of judges on the Court agree with him. But this result is not necessarily a good justification for thinking that Justice Dickson's arguments are more *persuasive* — either to you as a new law student, to seasoned practicing lawyers, or to some future group of judges on the Supreme Court. 

Next week, when we return to *Harrison v Carswell* for a second reading of the case, I will try to convince you that this question of who has the better or more persuasive arguments is not really an important question — or at least, it is not the *most* important question about *Harrison* — at this stage of your legal education. Rather than focusing on whether one or the other set of reasons are good or bad from a legal (or any other) standpoint, I will ask you to focus on the question of *how* the legal reasoning in *Harrison* actually works in practice. 

Here is another way of posing this challenge for you to think about before Week 2. In spite of everything the judges in *Harrison* seem to disagree about, they actually agree about a great many things. Justices Laskin and Dickson share a tremendous amount in common when it comes to the underlying *structure* and *style* of their arguments. Our first task is to describe this underlying structure. Only once you have come to appreciate what the judges share in common can you begin to grapple with the consequences of their different points of view.
