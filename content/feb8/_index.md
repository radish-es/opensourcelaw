[Professor Jamie Baxter](https://baxterlab.ca/authors/baxter/) from the Schulich School of Law will be in class on February 5 to discuss the issue of ***de facto* expropriation**.

**On the agenda:** *De facto* expropriations (or *regulatory takings*) have been top of mind for planners and municipal governments after the Supreme Court of Canada's big decision in *Annapolis Group Inc. v Halifax Regional Municipality* last October. 

- At issue in the case was a set of land use planning and zoning decisions taken by the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) to help conserve a peri-urban wilderness area called [Blue Mountain-Birch Cove](https://bluemountainfriends.ca).

- The Court said that the HRM may have taken regulatory action tantamount to "expropriating" a private developer's property, triggering obligations to pay compensation under Nova Scotia's *Expropriation Act*.

- Some [environmental groups](https://ecojustice.ca/case/preserving-governments-ability-to-regulate-land-usage-to-protect-the-environment/) worry that the *Annapolis* decision has opened the door too wide for private property owners to demand payment when public development controls impact their land. The case has the potential to significantly raise the public costs of land use planning. 

{{< spoiler text="Learn more" id="main" >}}

In this class, Professor Baxter will work with you to identify the circumstances that give rise to a legal claim based in *de facto* expropriation. 

We'll look at excerpts from two cases to understand how the law in this area is evolving:

- *Mariner Real Estate Ltd. v Nova Scotia* 

- *Annapolis Group Inc. v Halifax Regional Municipality*

**Why it matters:** We'll emphasize the question of why planners should care about all this. If local and provincial governments are on the hook for the private costs of development control, regional planning and conservation initiatives, they may do much less of all three in the future. At the very least, the  changes in the law of *de facto* expropriation we'll study this week could make planning processes considerably more uncertain, at least for now.

## What is *De Facto* Expropriation?

**The basics:** Expropriation is the subfield of property law that deals with governments' powers and obligations when taking away private property from its owners. 

{{< figure src="/media/expropriation.jpg" caption="Source: Jue Huang, Jared Murray and Chaewon Lee on Unsplash" >}}

Common examples of so-called *de jure* expropriations include government taking up private land to build important public works like a highway, or an airport, or an urban park. 

In Canada--unlike some other countries including the United States and South Africa--private owners have no ***constitutional*** protections against state expropriation of their property without compensation. 

- This means that our federal Parliament and the provincial and territorial legislatures can choose whether or not to place constraints on their own legal powers to expropriate. But those constraints are imposed largely as a matter of politics, not as a constitutional imperative.

**Look to the statute:** Nevertheless, every province has passed legislation that requires provincial and municipal governments to pay landowners **compensation** (generally at market value) when their property has been expropriated. For example, Nova Scotia's *Expropriation Act*, RSNS 1989, c 156 requires that:

> 24 Where land is expropriated, the statutory authority **shall** pay the owner compensation as is determined in accordance with this Act.

The *Expropriation Act* makes cases where private title is taken for a highway or a park--i.e., *de jure* expropriations--relatively straightforward. The landowner loses their title to the land and they are paid the market value in compensation for that loss.

**Not so simple:** But when governments exercise their regulatory powers to restrict what owners can do on their land *without* actually taking away the land title, does this amount to an expropriation requiring compensation?

For example, let's imagine that you own a vacant plot of land somewhere in a residential neighbourhood on in Halifax.

- Would you expect the City to compensate you for the "loss" of your property rights if it chooses to pass a zoning bylaw that restricts the height of any new construction on your land to two stories?

- What if the City passed a bylaw prohibiting construction of *any* new dwellings at all?

Once we cross over from *de jure* expropriation into the world of *de facto* takings, the legal lines around when just compensation is required get pretty blurry. 

- Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes of the United States Supreme Court might have put it best when he observed that "[g]overnment hardly could go on if, to some extent, values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law... But obviously the implied limitation must have its limits..." 

{{< spoiler text="Where we're headed" id="where" >}}

**Zoom out:** The legal rules developed by courts in Canada to identify when a *de facto* expropriation requiring compensation has taken place are relatively new. 

- The *Mariner Real Estate* decision by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal laid the groundwork for these rules in 1999. 

- The legal standard for claimants seeking compensation established by Justice Cromwell in *Mariner* was a very strict one, and thus very difficult for landowners to meet. Practically speaking, it put success in these cases well beyond the reach of most claimants, most of the time.

As you read the excerpt from *Mariner* below, consider the key points in this mini-lecture:

### Cromwell J.A. --

#### I. Introduction:

This case involves a collision of important interests. On one side, there are the interests of the respondents in the enjoyment of their privately owned land at Kingsburg Beach. On the other is the public interest in the protection and preservation of environmentally fragile and ecologically significant beach, dune and beach ridge resources. In the background of this case is the policy issue of how minutely government may control land without buying it. But in the foreground is the narrower issue of whether the stringent land use regulations applied by the Province to the respondents’ lands is an expropriation of them within the meaning of the *Expropriation Act*, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 156.

The respondents’ lands were designated as a beach under the *Beaches Act*, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 32. This designation brings with it a host of restrictions on the uses of and activities on the land. Pursuant to power conferred by the *Act* and Regulations made under it, the Minister refused to grant the respondents permission to build single family dwellings on their land. The respondents sued, claiming their lands had, in effect, been expropriated and that they were entitled to compensation. Tidman, J., at trial, found that there had been an expropriation.

In reaching this conclusion, the trial judge made two key findings. First, he decided that the respondents had been deprived of land within the meaning of the *Expropriation Act*. There were alternative bases for this finding. One basis was that the designation, on its own, was, in law, a taking of land. The alternative basis was that the taking resulted from the designation coupled with the application to the respondents’ lands of the regulatory regime flowing from the designation. These, in combination, in the judge’s view, took away virtually all of the land’s economic value and virtually extinguished all rights of ownership.

The second key holding by the trial judge was that the province acquired land within the meaning of the *Expropriation Act* because the regulation of the respondents’ lands enhanced the value of the provincially owned property from the high watermark seaward.

In my respectful view, the learned trial judge erred in each of these conclusions. For reasons which I will develop, my view is that the loss of economic value resulting from land use regulation is not a taking of land within the meaning of the  *Expropriation Act*. Further, in my opinion, the respondents did not establish either the loss of virtually all rights of ownership, or that the Province had acquired any land as a result of the designation. I would, therefore, allow the appeal, set aside the order of the trial judge and in its place make an order dismissing the respondents’ action.

#### III. Analysis:

##### (a) De facto Expropriation:

The respondents’ claim that what was, in form, a designation of their land under the *Beaches Act* is, in fact, a taking of their land by a statutory authority within the meaning of the *Expropriation Act*. This claim of *de facto* expropriation, or as it is known in United States constitutional law, regulatory taking, does not have a long history or clearly articulated basis in Canadian law. We were referred to only three Canadian cases in which such a claim was made successfully, only two of which dealt with the expropriation of land.

The scope of claims of *de facto* expropriation is very limited in Canadian law. They are constrained by two governing principles. The first is that valid legislation (primary or subordinate) or action taken lawfully with legislative authority may very significantly restrict an owner’s enjoyment of private land. The second is that the Courts may order compensation for such restriction only where authorized to do so by legislation. In other words, the only questions the Court is entitled to consider are whether the regulatory action was lawful and whether the *Expropriation Act* entitles the owner to compensation for the resulting restrictions.

*De facto* expropriation is conceptually difficult given the narrow parameters of the Court’s authority which I have just outlined. While *de facto* expropriation is concerned with whether the “rights” of ownership have been taken away, those rights are defined only by reference to lawful uses of land which may, by law, be severely restricted. In short, the bundle of rights associated with ownership carries with it the possibility of stringent land use regulation.

> [...]

In this country, extensive and restrictive land use regulation is the norm. Such regulation has, almost without exception, been found not to constitute compensable expropriation. It is settled law, for example, that the regulation of land use which has the effect of decreasing the value of the land is not an expropriation. As expressed in Ian Rogers, *Canadian Law of Planning and Zoning* (looseleaf, updated to 1999) at s.5.14, “The law permits the appropriation of prospective development rights for the good of the community but allows the property owner nothing in return.” Numerous cases support this proposition including *Belfast (City) v. O.D. Cars Ltd.* (supra) and *Calgary (City) v. Hartel Holdings Co.*, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 337 (S.C.C.). Many others are reviewed by Marceau, J. in *Alberta (Minister of Public Works, Supply & Services) v. Nilsson* (1999), 67 L.C.R. 1 (Alta. Q.B.) at para 35 ff. I would refer, as well, to the following from E.C.E. Todd, *The Law of Expropriation in Canada*, (2nd, 1992) at pp. 22-23:

> Traditionally the property concept is thought of as a bundle of rights of which one of the most important is that of user. At common law this right was virtually unlimited and subject only to the restraints imposed by the law of public and private nuisance. At a later stage in the evolution of property law the use of land might be limited by the terms of restrictive covenants.

> Today the principal restrictions on land use arise from the planning and zoning provisions of public authorities. *By the imposition, removal or alteration of land use controls a public authority may dramatically increase, or decrease, the value of land by changing the permitted uses which may be made of it. In such a case, in the absence of express statutory provision to the contrary an owner is not entitled to compensation or any other remedy notwithstanding that subdivision approval or rezoning is refused or development is blocked or frozen pursuant to statutory planning powers* in order, for example, to facilitate the future acquisition of the land for public purposes. “Ordinarily, in this country, the United States and the United Kingdom, compensation does not follow zoning either up or down ... (but) a taker may not, through the device of zoning, depress the value of property as a prelude to compulsory taking of the property for a public purpose .... (emphasis added)

> [...]

In light of this long tradition of vigorous land use regulation, the test that has developed for applying the *Expropriation Act* to land use restrictions is exacting and, of course, the respondents on appeal as the plaintiffs at trial, had the burden of proving that they met it. In each of the three Canadian cases which have found compensation payable for *de facto* expropriations, the result of the governmental action went beyond drastically limiting use or reducing the value of the owner’s property. In  *British Columbia v. Tener*, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 533 (S.C.C.), the denial of the permit meant that access to the respondents’ mineral rights was completely negated, or as Wilson, J. put it at p. 552, amounted to total denial of that interest. In *Casamiro Resource Corp. v. British Columbia (Attorney General)* (1991), 80 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (B.C. C.A.), which closely parallels Tener, the private rights had become “meaningless”. (1978), [1979] 1 S.C.R. 101 (S.C.C.) In *Manitoba Fisheries Ltd. v. R.* (1978), [1979] 1 S.C.R. 101 (S.C.C.), the legislation absolutely prohibited the claimant from carrying on its business.

In reviewing the *de facto* expropriation cases, R.J. Bauman concluded, and I agree, that to constitute a *de facto* expropriation, there must be a confiscation of “... all *reasonable* private uses of the lands in question.”: R.J. Bauman, "Exotic Expropriations: Government Action and Compensation" (1994), 54 *The Advocate* 561 at 574. While there is no magic formula for determining (or describing) the point at which regulation ends and taking begins, I think that Marceau, J.’s formulation in *Nilsson* is helpful. The question is whether the regulation is of “sufficient severity to remove virtually all of the rights associated with the property holder’s interest.” (at para 48).

Considerations of a claim of *de facto* expropriation must recognize that the effect of the particular regulation must be compared with reasonable use of the lands in modern Canada, not with their use as if they were in some imaginary state of nature unconstrained by regulation. In modern Canada, extensive land use regulation is the norm and it should not be assumed that ownership carries with it any exemption from such regulation. As stated in *Belfast (City)*, there is a distinction between the numerous “rights” (or the “bundle of rights”) associated with ownership and ownership itself. The “rights” of ownership and the concept of reasonable use of the land include regulation in the public interest falling short of what the Australian cases have called deprivation of the reality of proprietorship: see e.g. *Newcrest Mining (W.A.) Ltd. v. Australia (Commonwealth)* (1996), 190 C.L.R. 513 (Australia H.C.) at p. 633. In other words, what is, in form, regulation will be held to be expropriation only when virtually all of the aggregated incidents of ownership have been taken away. The extent of this bundle of rights of ownership must be assessed, not only in relation to the land’s potential highest and best use, but having regard to the nature of the land and the range of reasonable uses to which it has actually been put. It seems to me there is a significant difference in this regard between, for example, environmentally fragile dune land which, by its nature, is not particularly well-suited for residential development and which has long been used for primarily recreational purposes and a lot in a residential subdivision for which the most reasonable use is for residential construction.

##### (c) Is loss of economic value loss of land under the *Expropriation Act*?

The trial judge found that the respondents had been deprived of land. His main conclusion appears to have been that the loss of “virtually all economic value” constituted the loss of an interest in land. He also found, however, that the “... fee simple in the [respondents’] lands has been stripped of its whole bundle of rights.” Both aspects of his holding are before us in this appeal and, in my respectful view, both are in error.

The judge found as a fact that the plaintiffs had lost virtually all economic value of their lands. That is a question of fact. The trial judge decided to accept the evidence of the respondents’ expert, Mr. Hardy, on this point. While there was some attempt to attack it in this Court, I conclude that the finding is reasonable and supported by the evidence at trial and should not, therefore, be disturbed on appeal.

The judge further found that the loss of virtually all economic value was the loss of land within the meaning of the *Expropriation Act*. This holding contains two key elements: that the loss of all economic value is the loss of land within the meaning of the *Act*, and further, that the loss of virtually all economic value is a taking of land as those phrases appear in the *Expropriation Act*.

> [...]

The important point is this. While the distinction between the value of land and interests in land is, in one sense highly technical, it is, nonetheless, deeply imbedded in the scheme of compensation provided for under the *Expropriation Act*. It is fundamental to the entitlement to compensation under the *Act* claimed by the respondents. This is so because the distinction defines the line between cases in which governmental interference with the enjoyment of land is compensable under the *Act* and cases in which it is not. An impressive argument may be made supporting a broader approach to compensation for governmental interference with the enjoyment of land. The logic of drawing the line based on whether an interest in land has been lost may, as noted by Wilson, J. above, be seriously questioned. Nonetheless, the *Expropriation Act* draws the line in this way. It is, therefore, necessary to give the legislation an interpretation consistent with the words employed and the underlying policy decision which they reflect.

I conclude, therefore, that the learned trial judge erred in holding that the loss of virtually all economic value of the respondents’ land, was the loss of an interest in land within the meaning of the *Expropriation Act*.

##### (d) Loss of the “bundle of rights”

That brings me to the trial judge’s holding that the effect of the designation and the way it was applied here was to strip the fee simple of its whole bundle of rights. The cases have long recognized that at a certain point, regulation is, in effect, confiscation. The law insists that the substance of the situation, not simply its form, be examined. As noted in *Nilsson*, restrictions on the use of land may be so stringent and all-encompassing that they have the effect of depriving the owner of his or her interest in the land, although leaving paper title undisturbed.

While the decline in economic value of land is not the loss of an interest in land, it may be *evidence* of the loss of an interest in land. As the respondents’ appraiser, Mr. Hardy, stated in his report, the value of land is a reflection of several factors, including the scope of the incidents of ownership attached to the lands in question: 

> Our consideration of the legal basis and economic factors of value in land valuation concluded that it is the rights of ownership that give land value and it is these rights that are the subject of valuation. When the rights of ownership are excessively restricted or removed, it is logical that the value of the land is diminished, destroyed or made idle.

It follows that, where the effect of land use regulation is to eliminate virtually all the normal incidents of ownership, this will be reflected in the market value of the land. It is not, however, the decline in market value that constitutes the loss of an interest in land, but the taking away of the incidents of ownership reflected in that decline.

We have been referred to only three Canadian cases in which compensation has been ordered where governmental regulatory action has been held to be a *de facto* expropriation: *Tener*, *Casamiro Resource Corp.* and *Manitoba Fisheries Ltd.* I have already reviewed these cases earlier in my reasons. Judging by these cases, *de facto* expropriations are very rare in Canada and they require proof of virtual extinction of an identifiable interest in land (or, in *Manitoba Fisheries Ltd.*, of an interest in property).

The respondents submit that the *Beaches Act* and the Regulations, coupled with the refusal of Ministerial permission for development, prohibit virtually all activities normally associated with the ownership of land. The trial judge accepted this submission.

Preclusion of residential development, as proposed by the respondents, particularly on lands of this environmental sensitivity, is not, of itself, the extinguishment of virtually all rights associated with ownership. For example, *Mariner* and *20102660 N.S. Limited* proposed to build using standard concrete basements. In considering these applications, the Minister had before him the Jacques Whitford report which opined that standard concrete foundations would cause serious damage to the dune systems. Furthermore, it was clear on the evidence that the building of residences on two of the Moshers’ lots (i.e., the cemetery and garden lots) would not be permitted, quite apart from the *Beaches Act*. Yet it is not submitted that the requirements dealing with lot size and septic requirements constitute expropriation because they, in effect, prevent building residences on these lots.

With respect, the trial judge erred in finding that the *Beaches Act* designation and ensuing regulation resulted in the expropriation of these two of the Moshers’ properties. Residences could not be built on them prior to the designation, and there is no evidence that permission for other uses has been refused.

What of the properties for which permission to build single family dwellings was refused? The trial judge found that virtually all incidents of ownership had been removed through that refusal and the other restrictions applied to the land. With great respect to the trial judge, I disagree.

Many of the restricted activities may be authorized by permit. These include most of the traditional recreational uses described by Mrs. Mosher in her evidence. However, there is no evidence that a permit has been sought for any of these kinds of activities, much less refused. That being so, it is hard to follow the respondents’ argument that all of these things are prohibited. As noted earlier, it is not the requirement to obtain a permit that constrains the enjoyment of the land, but its refusal. When, as here, the claim is that the impact of a regulatory scheme has, in effect, taken away *all* rights of ownership, it is not the existence of the regulatory authority that is significant, but its *actual application* to the lands. As stated in *MacDonald, Sommer & Frates*, supra, the Court cannot determine whether regulation has gone too far unless it knows how far the regulation goes.

The respondents in this case proved at trial that they would not be allowed to build the proposed single family residences. With respect to three of the Mosher’s lots, there was not even an application to build; as mentioned, residential development on two of those lots was probably impossible quite apart from the designation. Some reasonable or traditional uses of this dune property may be allowed by permit. Aside from the applications to build fences, no applications for permits relating to these other uses have been made, let alone refused. The respondents had the burden of proving that virtually all incidents of ownership (having regard to reasonable uses of the land in question) have, in effect, been taken away. Neither the respondents nor the Province appear to have explored the possibility that development specifically designed in a way consistent with protection of the dunes might occur. The respondents, while asserting that all reasonable uses of the land are precluded by the operation of the *Act* and Regulations, have not shown that they would be denied the required permits with respect to such other reasonable or traditional uses of the lands. In short, there is an absence of evidence relating to environmentally appropriate development plans on the land in question, and an absence of evidence of refusal of permission for the respondents to engage in other reasonable or traditional uses. These, in combination, result, in my opinion, in the respondents having failed to establish that virtually all incidents of ownership have, by the effect of the *Act* and Regulations, been taken away.

I would conclude, therefore, that the respondents failed to establish that they had been deprived of land within the meaning of the *Expropriation Act*.

##### (e) Acquisition of Land

As noted, there must not only be a taking away of land from the owner but also the acquisition of land by the expropriating authority for there to be an expropriation within the meaning of the *Act*.

There is no suggestion here that the Province acquired legal title or any aspect of it. The land remains private property although subject to the regulatory regime established by the *Beaches Act*. The argument is that the effect of the regulatory scheme is, for practical purposes, the acquisition of an interest in land.

> [...]

Returning to the respondents’ submissions in this case, in my opinion, the freezing of development and strict regulation of the designated lands did not, of itself, confer any interest in land on the Province or any other instrumentality of government. I am reinforced in this opinion by many cases dealing with zoning and other forms of land use regulation. Estey, J., in *Tener*, notes that ordinarily compensation does not follow zoning either up or down. The Supreme Court of Canada in *Dell Holdings Ltd.*, *supra*, accepted the general proposition that, under our law, owners caught up in the zoning or planning process, but not expropriated, must simply accept the loss (provided, of course, that the regulatory actions are otherwise lawful). Development freezes have consistently been held not to give rise to rights of compensation: for a review of the authorities, see *Nilsson*, *supra*. One of the bases of these decisions is that the restriction of development generally does not result in the acquisition of an interest in land by the regulating authority.

There was no evidence that the economic value of the Crown’s land was enhanced. Even if its value could be considered to be enhanced in some other sense, such enhancement, in my view, is not an acquisition of land for the purposes of the *Expropriation Act*.

I conclude that the trial judge erred on this aspect of the case. In my respectful view, regulation enhancing the value of public property, if established, is not an acquisition of “land” within the meaning of the *Expropriation Act*.

> [...]

#### IV. Disposition:

I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the trial judge and in its place make an order dismissing the action. The case raises several important issues which, in my view, it was in the public interest to have resolved. For that reason, I would not disturb the trial judge’s order for costs at trial and I would make no order as to costs of the appeal.

*Appeal allowed.*

</div></div>

## The Shifting Legal Standard

The legal framework for *de facto* expropriation established in *Mariner* was mostly affirmed in a later Supreme Court of Canada case, *Canadian Pacific Railway v Vancouver (City*). 

- As you read the *Annapolis* decision, next, you might notice that the judges seem to disagree on whether the majority judgement "changes" or "clarifies" the pre-existing law. 

- This argument between the judges is mainly semantics. There is no question that the majority's decision shifts the legal test to be applied in claims for compensation based on *de facto* expropriation. The important questions are about *how* the law has changed, *why* it has changed, and *who benefits* from the shift. 

## Annapolis Group Inc. v Halifax Regional Municipality, 2022 SCC 36

{{< figure src="/media/blue_mountain_map.jpg" caption="" >}}

<div class="case-wrap"><div class="case">

### Côté, Brown JJ. --

#### I. Overview

This appeal calls upon the Court to clarify the circumstances in which state regulation of land use may effect a *de facto* or (as we will refer to it) “constructive” taking of private property.

The appellant, Annapolis Group Inc., contends that the respondent, Halifax Regional Municipality, improperly used its regulatory powers to effectively seize Annapolis’ land for use as a public park without compensation. Halifax says that Annapolis’ claim is a veiled attempt to make taxpayers foot the bill for a decades-long development gamble. It sought summary dismissal of this part of Annapolis’ claim, while permitting other claims (for misfeasance in public office and unjust enrichment) to proceed to trial.

Although unsuccessful at first instance, Halifax persuaded the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal that it should apply this Court’s judgment in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Vancouver (City) 2006 SCC 5, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 227 (“CPR”), to strike that claim. Annapolis asks this Court to restore its claim in respect of the alleged constructive taking and allow it to proceed to trial.

We would allow Annapolis’ appeal. 

> [...]

#### II. Factual Background

Over time from the 1950s, Annapolis acquired the subject property, comprising 965 acres of land ("Annapolis Lands" or "Lands"), with the intention of eventually securing enhanced development rights and reselling it.

In 2006, Halifax adopted the Regional Municipal Planning Strategy, a guide for land development in the municipality, including the Annapolis Lands, over a 25-year period. While the Planning Strategy reserved a portion of the Annapolis Lands for possible future inclusion in a regional park, it also zoned the Lands as “Urban Settlement” and “Urban Reserve”. Urban Settlement denotes an area where urban forms of development may occur. Urban Reserve identifies land that could be developed beyond the 25-year horizon. These designations thus contemplate — but do not permit — future residential serviced development. For serviced development to occur on the Annapolis Lands, Halifax must adopt a resolution authorizing a “secondary planning process” and an amendment to the applicable land use by-law. The applicable by-law is the *Halifax Mainland Land Use By-Law*, also adopted in 2006.

In 2014, Halifax adopted a revised version of the Planning Strategy. The Urban Settlement and Urban Reserve designations were maintained, and thus the zoning of the Annapolis Lands did not change, and has not changed since 2006. Nor were the conceptual boundaries for the potential park altered.

Beginning in 2007, Annapolis made several attempts to develop the Lands. Ultimately, by resolution dated September 6, 2016, Halifax refused to initiate the secondary planning process, and Annapolis sued, alleging a constructive taking, misfeasance in public office, and unjust enrichment.

At issue in this appeal is Annapolis’ allegation of a constructive taking. Specifically, Annapolis says that Halifax’s regulatory measures have deprived it of all reasonable or economic uses of its land, resulting in a constructive taking without compensation, contrary to ss. 65 and 237 of the Halifax Regional Municipality Charter, S.N.S. 2008, c. 39, and ss. 6 and 24 of the Expropriation Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 156. It alleges in particular that Halifax has acquired a beneficial interest in the Lands by exercising dominion over them so as to effectively create a public park at Annapolis’ expense. According to Annapolis, members of the public hike, cycle, canoe, camp, and swim on the Lands, are encouraged to do so by Halifax, and Halifax financially supports organizations that also encourage people to use the Lands as a park. Further, signs posted on the Lands allegedly depict the municipality’s logo and phone number, and a media article quotes a municipal employee referred to as “the city staffer overseeing the park’s creation”.

On March 11, 2019, Halifax moved for partial summary judgment of Annapolis’ claim, pursuant to r. 13 of the Nova Scotia Civil Procedure Rules. In its motion, Halifax sought the dismissal of Annapolis’ constructive taking claim and urged the motion judge to find that, as a matter of law, a constructive taking cannot result from Halifax refusing to amend the Planning Strategy and associated land use by-laws. Annapolis resisted the motion, arguing that its claim raises genuine issues of material fact requiring a trial.

#### V. Analysis

##### A. Overview of the Law of Takings

It is useful to begin with a brief overview of the law of takings. Given the facts of this appeal, our focus is on expropriation through regulation — which, again, we refer to as a “constructive taking” in preference to other commonly applied terms such as “*de facto*” or “regulatory taking”, as in our view it more accurately captures the nature of the state action at issue and the effect on the landowner (see e.g., M. Lavoie, “Canadian Common Law and Civil Law Approaches to Constructive Takings: A Comparative Economic Perspective” (2010), 42 Ottawa L. Rev. 229).

A “taking” is a “forcible acquisition by the Crown of privately owned property ... for public purposes” (K. Horsman and G. Morley, eds., *Government Liability: Law and Practice* (loose-leaf), at § 5:1). It may take the form of a constructive taking (effective appropriation of private property by a public authority exercising its regulatory powers), or a *de jure* taking (formal expropriation), by (in the case of land) taking title.

To be clear, not every instance of regulating the use of property amounts to a constructive taking. Governments and municipalities holding delegated provincial regulatory authority (Toronto (City) v. Ontario (Attorney General), 2021 SCC 34, at para. 2) validly regulate land in the public interest without effecting “takings”, properly understood (see Compliance Coal Corporation v. British Columbia (Environmental Assessment Office), 2020 BCSC 621, 13 L.C.R. (2d) 215, at para. 91). The line between a valid regulation and a constructive taking is crossed where the *effect* of the regulatory activity deprives a claimant of the use and enjoyment of its property in a substantial and unreasonable way, or effectively confiscates the property (Horsman and Morley, at § 5:2). Put simply, “in order for a Crown measure to effect a constructive taking of property, private rights in the property must be virtually abolished, leaving the plaintiff with ‘*no reasonable use*’ of the property” (Horsman and Morley, at § 5:13 (emphasis added)).

A series of lower court judgments affirm that, in general, Canadian courts require a “total loss of the plaintiff’s interest in property for the Crown’s action to constitute a taking” (Horsman and Morley, at § 5:13; see also *Lynch v. St. John’s (City)*, 2016 NLCA 35, 400 D.L.R. (4th) 62; Sun Construction Company Limited v. Conception Bay South (Town)2019 NLSC 102, 87 M.P.L.R. (5th) 256(N.L. S.C.) ). Courts have, therefore, dismissed claims for compensation where the regulation left the owner *some* reasonable use for the property (Genevieve Holdings Ltd. v. Kamloops (City)198842 M.P.L.R. 171 (B.C. Co. Ct.); *Steer Holdings Ltd. v. Manitoba*, [1992] 2 W.W.R. 558 (Man. Q.B.), aff’d (1992), 99 D.L.R. (4th) 61 (Man. C.A.); Purchase v. Terrace (City)199526 M.P.L.R. (2d) 126 (B.C.S.C.); *Harvard Investments Ltd. v. Winnipeg (City)*, (1995), 129 D.L.R. (4th) 557 (Man. C.A.)).

At common law, taking of property by the state must be authorized by law, and triggers a presumptive right to compensation which can be displaced only by clear statutory language showing a contrary intention — that is, an intention *not* to compensate (see P. A. Warchuk, “Rethinking Compensation for Expropriation” (2015), 48 U.B.C. L. Rev. 655, at pp. 656 and 678-81). This was recognized in *Attorney-General v. De Keyser’s Royal Hotel*, [1920] A.C. 508 (H.L.), wherein Lord Atkinson stated: “The recognized rule for the construction of statutes is that, unless the words of the statute clearly so demand, a statute is not to be construed so as to take away the property of a subject without compensation” (p. 542). 

> [...]

This legal backdrop brings us to *CPR*, and its elaboration of the common law rule in the form of a two-part test for showing a constructive taking: “... (1) an acquisition of *a beneficial interest* in the property or flowing from it, and (2) removal of all reasonable uses of the property ...” (para. 30 (emphasis added), citing *Mariner*, at p. 716; *Manitoba Fisheries* ; *Tener* ). The issues present in this appeal require us to consider the meaning of a “beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it” under the first part of that test. In bringing greater clarity to this aspect of the *CPR* test, we do not change the doctrine of constructive takings, but simply apply it to the facts of the present dispute. As we will explain, the Court in *CPR* did not use “beneficial interest” in the technical sense that it carries in the domain of equity. Rather, a “beneficial interest” is to be more broadly understood as an “advantage” — hence the Court’s coupling of “beneficial interest” with the phrase “or flowing from [the property]”. Clearly, if the interest acquired by the state can be one which *flows from* the property, what must be shown by the property owner can fall short of an *actual* acquisition by the state.

Further, we must also decide the relevance, if any, under the second part of the test of the public authority’s intended use of the land.

##### B. “Beneficial Interest"

The Court of Appeal, it will be recalled, held that the first part of the test stated in *CPR* — the “acquisition of a beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it” — requires Annapolis to show that Halifax *actually acquired* the Lands. Deciding whether this is so requires that we give meaning to the expression “beneficial interest”, as it was used in *CPR*. In our view, that meaning is best appreciated by considering the authorities upon which *CPR* relied in stating that condition, and especially this Court’s decisions in *Manitoba Fisheries* and *Tener* . As we will explain, doing so reveals that actual acquisition is not necessary; rather, the obtaining by Halifax of an *advantage* in respect of the Lands suffices.

> [...]

In our view, the foregoing jurisprudence — upon which the *CPR* test was expressly stated as resting — supports an understanding of “beneficial interest” as concerned with the *effect* of a regulatory measure on the landowner, and not with whether a proprietary interest was actually acquired by the government. Conversely, that same jurisprudence supports the view that “beneficial interest”, as that term appears in the first part of the test stated in *CPR*, refers *not* to actual acquisition of the equity that rests with the beneficial owner of property connoting rights of use and enjoyment, but to an “advantage” flowing to the state. We say this for two reasons.

First, to require actual acquisition would collapse the distinction between constructive (*de facto*) and *de jure* takings — a distinction which *CPR* explicitly preserves (paras. 30-37). Simply put, if a constructive taking requires an *actual* taking, then it is no longer constructive. It follows that the Court of Appeal’s requirement of an actual acquisition of the Annapolis Lands cannot be necessary to satisfy the *CPR* test for a constructive taking.

Secondly, interpreting “beneficial interest” broadly (as meaning a benefit or advantage accruing to the state) ensures *CPR*’s coherence to *Manitoba Fisheries* and *Tener* , neither of which understood “benefits” in the strict equitable sense of that term. Again, the references to those authorities in *CPR* demonstrate that *CPR* merely sought to affirm, and not to alter, our law of constructive takings. This interpretation is supported by the explicit wording under the first part of the *CPR* test: “... a beneficial interest in the property *or flowing from it* ...” (para. 30 (emphasis added)). An interest flowing from the property affirms that a “beneficial interest” can be more broadly understood as an advantage, and need not be an actual acquisition.

To be clear, we are not “depart[ing] from precedent” (para. 111), as our colleagues contend. We aim to illuminate *CPR*, not overrule it. Our colleagues say that courts “have applied the *CPR* test without difficulty” (para. 112). With respect, this misses the point. The key question is whether the lower courts have applied the *CPR* test *correctly*. In our respectful view, many of them have not. Indeed, the Court of Appeal itself misapprehended the law in this case, by asserting that *CPR* requires an *actual* expropriation to establish a constructive taking. As we have explained, and as the authorities confirm, *CPR* — properly understood — trains the court’s eye on whether a public authority has derived an advantage, in *effect*, from private property, not on whether it has formally acquired a proprietary interest in the land. To hold otherwise would be to erase the long-standing distinction between *de jure* and *de facto* expropriation from Canadian law.

As a final observation, we acknowledge that, in addition to *Manitoba Fisheries* and *Tener* , the Court in *CPR* also cited to *Mariner* . But this does not affect our analysis. *Mariner* concerned the Province of Nova Scotia’s designation of privately owned land as a beach under a provincial statute that subjected it to stringent conservation regulations. When the Minister refused the respondents’ applications to build homes on the land, they sought a declaration that the Crown had expropriated their lands, entitling them to compensation. Cromwell J.A. (as he then was), writing for the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, held that the respondents’ loss of economic value did not amount to an advantage acquired by the provincial authority (see generally *Mariner*, at pp. 713-16).

*Mariner* illustrates that regulation alone will not satisfy the test for a constructive taking; there must be something more “beyond drastically limiting use or reducing the value of the owner’s property” (p. 716). When this threshold is crossed — that is, where all reasonable uses have been removed — a regulation may be, “*in effect*, confiscation” (p. 727 (emphasis added)). To be clear, *Mariner* does not stray from focussing on both the *effect* of the taking and the *advantage* acquired by the government, as required by this Court’s jurisprudence and affirmed in the test set out in *CPR*. Rather, and consistent with both *Manitoba Fisheries* and *Tener* , *Mariner* asked whether the *effect* of the regulation was to remove an interest in land (*Mariner*, at p. 722, referring to *Tener* ).

> [...]

In sum, we affirm that the test to show a constructive taking is that stated by *CPR*, properly understood. The reviewing court must decide: (1) whether the public authority has acquired a *beneficial interest* in the property or flowing from it (i.e. an advantage); and (2) whether the state action has removed all reasonable uses of the property. This gives effect to this Court’s acknowledgement of a common law right to compensation where the two-part *CPR* test is satisfied. It accords with imperatives of justice and fairness, which underpin the court’s assessment of expropriation claims, and remedies situations where cases do not neatly fit within the expropriation legislative framework and would otherwise “fall between the cracks” (Warchuk, at pp. 686 and 690).

To this, we would add that, because the test focusses on *effects* and *advantages*, substance and not form is to prevail. A court deciding whether a regulatory measure effects a constructive taking must undertake a realistic appraisal of matters in the context of the specific case, including but not limited to:

a. The nature of the government action (i.e., whether it targets a specific owner or more generally advances an important public policy objective), notice to the owner of the restrictions at the time the property was acquired, and whether the government measures restrict the uses of the property in a manner consistent with the owner’s reasonable expectations;

b. The nature of the land and its historical or current uses. Where, for example, the land is undeveloped, the prohibition of all *potential* reasonable uses may amount to a constructive taking. That said, a mere reduction in land value due to land use regulation, on its own, would not suffice; and

c.  The substance of the alleged advantage. The case law reveals that an advantage may take various forms. For example, permanent or indefinite denial of access to the property or the government’s permanent or indefinite occupation of the property would constitute a taking (*Sun Construction* , at para. 15). Likewise, regulations that leave a rights holder with only notional use of the land, deprived of all economic value, would satisfy the test. It could also include confining the uses of private land to public purposes, such as conservation, recreation, or institutional uses such as parks, schools, or municipal buildings.

##### E. Application

###### (1) Halifax’s Alleged Acquisition of a Beneficial Interest in the Annapolis Lands

First, it is disputed whether Halifax is promoting the Annapolis Lands as a public park, for instance by encouraging public use and holding them out as a park, as Annapolis alleges. This disputed fact is material because, if proven, it would tend to support Annapolis’ claim that Halifax acquired a “beneficial interest” in the Lands, as we have explained it. Preserving a park in its natural state may constitute an advantage accruing to the state, thus satisfying the “acquisition” element of *CPR*.

To be clear, we reject the Court of Appeal’s formalistic position that a public authority’s alleged encouragement and financial support of trespass can never amount to an acquisition of a beneficial interest. Several cases support the proposition that whether a public authority treats private lands as an extension of a public park is a key factor in assessing the acquisition requirement. For instance, in *Benjamin*, the Quebec Court of Appeal found that the City of Montréal’s knowing use of private land as a public park — entailing the installation of lampposts, a fence, and signage indicating the location of the “park” that included the subject lands — in conjunction with restrictive zoning, effectively constituted a “disguised expropriation” (paras. 65 and 82).

Similarly, in *Dupras v. Ville de Mascouche*, 2020 QCCS 2538, the Quebec Superior Court held that the City had effectively expropriated the claimant’s lands by subjecting them to “conservation” zoning and treating them as if they were part of a public park. Notably, the City had (1) marked off trails, (2) added signage with park maps covering the subject land, (3) encouraged the public to use the lands on the park, and (4) taken out insurance to cover public recreational activities on the land (see paras. 137-40). The Quebec Court of Appeal affirmed the Superior Court’s reasoning and dismissed the respondent city’s cross-appeal on the finding of disguised expropriation (2022 QCCA 350, at paras. 27-40).

A similar claim in *Steer Holdings* failed, but for reasons which distinguish it from the allegations here. In *Steer Holdings* , the Manitoba Court of Appeal held that no benefit was acquired where there was “no suggestion that people will be encouraged in any way to move from the nature park to the subject property” (p. 67). Moreover, the land was not adjacent to the provincial park. The Court of Appeal thus rejected the argument that the Province of Manitoba had effectively enlarged its park system.

As we have explained, and as the cases confirm, the doctrine of constructive takings looks to the *effects* of state action; it does not require a formal acquisition of a proprietary interest by the state. The absence of such a proprietary interest does not preclude the argument that, *in effect*, Halifax has functionally treated the Annapolis Lands as if they were a park for the benefit of the public. If proven, this fact would support Annapolis’ claim that Halifax acquired a beneficial interest in its property. It is, therefore, plainly material.

###### (2) Halifax’s Alleged Removal of All Reasonable Uses of the Annapolis Lands

Second, it is disputed whether Halifax, by allegedly treating the Annapolis Lands as a public park, has eliminated all uses of the Lands except serviced development, which is conditional upon the approval of Annapolis’ secondary planning applications.

This disputed fact is material because, if proven, it may arguably support Annapolis’ claim that it has lost all reasonable uses of its property. This would leave Annapolis to shoulder the burden of holding the Lands as a public park indefinitely, while Halifax enjoys the advantage of having the Lands reserved for its own purposes without having to pay compensation. It is notable that the Court of Appeal, after observing that “Annapolis’ reasonable uses of its lands have not changed”, failed to identify a single reasonable possible use of the property (para. 92; see Lynch, at para. 63).

Further, the Court of Appeal’s reasoning — to which our colleagues subscribe — cuts against one of the core lessons from *Mariner* , being to look to “*the actual application* of the regulatory scheme as opposed simply to its potential for interference with the owner’s activities” (p. 718 (emphasis added)). In concluding that there had been no taking in the present case, the Court of Appeal leaned heavily on the fact that the zoning rules had not changed, such that Annapolis’ land use rights remained the same after the release of the 2006 Planning Strategy. But the Court of Appeal neglected to consider Halifax’s *application* of the regulatory scheme as alleged by Annapolis. Indeed, *Manitoba Fisheries* , *Tener* , and *Mariner* all stand for the proposition that a regulation does not *per se* eliminate all reasonable uses of property where it provides a mechanism for permits, exemptions, or licenses to allow activities that are otherwise prohibited. In such cases, it is not the regulation alone that effects a constructive taking, but the *application* of that regulation to the land, including the manner in which the public authority *refuses* to grant the permit, exemption, or license (see *Manitoba Fisheries* , at p. 103 (taking of the goodwill resulting from the refusal by the Crown corporation to grant a license or exemption for the export of fish); *Tener*, at pp. 564-65 (Crown’s notice denying a permit to conduct development work found to be an “expropriation” of the mineral rights)). In sum, “[w]hen ... the claim is that the impact of a regulatory scheme has, in effect, taken away *all* rights of ownership, it is not the existence of the regulatory authority that is significant, but its *actual application* to the lands” (*Mariner*, at p. 729 (emphasis in original)). Therefore, the Court of Appeal erred in focussing solely on the “longstanding zoning *status quo* for the Lands” (R.F., at para. 18) since the passing of the *Halifax Mainland Land Use By-Law* in 2006.

According to Annapolis, Halifax has repeatedly refused to initiate the secondary planning process which could lead to the re-zoning of the Annapolis Lands. If Annapolis can prove at trial that Halifax is unlikely to *ever* grant secondary planning approval, this is clearly material to its constructive taking claim. In our view, all reasonable uses of land may be shown to have been eliminated where a permit needed to make reasonable use of the land is refused, such that the state has effectively taken away all rights of ownership.

We note our colleagues’ characterization of Halifax’s alleged conduct as a mere “refusal to up-zone” which did not affect the reasonable uses of the Annapolis Lands. Our colleagues say that Halifax’s alleged conduct “simply disappointed” Annapolis’ hopes of cashing in on a speculative investment (para. 145). For several reasons, we respectfully reject this view.

First, Annapolis did not acquire the Lands as a “speculative bet” (para. 145). Annapolis acquired most of the Lands in 1956, slowly adding to its holdings over time. Crucially, Halifax did not regulate land use in the relevant area prior to 1982. In other words, nothing prevented Annapolis from developing the Lands when they were first acquired. The conduct alleged is therefore not a mere “refusal to up-zone”, as our colleagues say (para. 115). Annapolis originally had the right to use the Lands at its discretion. It now alleges that Halifax eliminated this right and thereby secured a public advantage without compensation.

Secondly, and again with respect, our colleagues incorrectly characterize our position as an assertion that a “refusal to up-zone vacant land” is tantamount to a constructive taking (para. 151). A refusal to up-zone, standing alone, will not generally remove *all* reasonable uses of vacant land. As we have explained, Halifax’s alleged conduct in this case is more than a mere refusal to up-zone. Annapolis claims that Halifax has effectively transformed its Lands into a public park. We emphasize, however, that Halifax may defeat Annapolis’ constructive taking claim by showing a *single* reasonable use of the property.

In this regard, it is telling that our colleagues do not identify *any* reasonable use of the Annapolis Lands. The mere (theoretical) possibility for Annapolis to lease the lands is not indicative of any reasonable use of the property — as our colleagues implicitly recognize in discussing *Benjamin*. As they acknowledge, the City in *Benjamin* “render[ed] any use of the land practically impossible” (para. 139), despite the absence of any restrictions on leasing. In any event, it is not realistic to assert that Annapolis may lease lands which, according to its allegations, are already used as a public park by Halifax.

Moreover, in most cases, a public authority will not benefit from a refusal to up-zone vacant land. As such, even if all reasonable uses of land are eliminated by a zoning refusal, the first element of the *CPR* test for a constructive taking would not ordinarily be met. Accordingly, we cannot agree with our colleagues that our approach “dramatically expands the potential liability of municipalities engaged in land use regulation” (para. 115). To the contrary, our approach is firmly rooted in the common law and does not encroach on the general rule that a refusal to up-zone does not itself effect a constructive taking.

Lastly, we reiterate that provincial legislatures remain free, as they always have been, to “alter the common law” in respect of constructive takings (*CPR*, at para. 37, referring to the immunity conferred by s. 569 of the Vancouver Charter) — by, in this case, immunizing Halifax by statute from the obligation to pay compensation for taking private property in the public interest.

In light of the foregoing, the Court of Appeal erred in striking Annapolis’ claim related to the alleged constructive taking. There are genuine issues of material fact to be tried.

#### VI. Disposition

We would allow the appeal, set aside the Court of Appeal’s partial summary judgment order, and restore the motion judge’s order dismissing Halifax’s motion for partial summary judgment, with costs throughout. Annapolis’ claim against Halifax, in its entirety, may proceed to trial.

### Kasirer, Jamal JJ. (dissenting) --

#### I. Overview

We have had the advantage of reading the reasons of our colleagues Côté and Brown JJ. With respect for their views, we conclude that the appeal should be dismissed.

This Court summarized the test for a *de facto* (or constructive) taking at common law in its unanimous decision in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Vancouver (City) 2006 SCC 5, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 227 (“CPR”), at para. 30, per McLachlin C.J.:

> For a *de facto* taking requiring compensation at common law, two requirements must be met: (1) an acquisition of a beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it, and (2) removal of all reasonable uses of the property (see *Mariner Real Estate Ltd. v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General)* (1999), 177 D.L.R. (4th) 696(N.S.C.A.), at p. 716; *Manitoba Fisheries Ltd. v. The Queen*, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 101; and *The Queen in Right of British Columbia v. Tener*, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 533).

Annapolis Group Inc. has asked this Court to depart from this precedent. It urges the Court to allow its appeal from the order of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal granting partial summary judgment dismissing its claim against Halifax Regional Municipality for a *de facto* taking of its lands. Annapolis invited — and needs — this Court to depart from *CPR* for its claim to proceed to trial.

Our colleagues Côté and Brown JJ. have accepted Annapolis’ invitation and propose to change the *CPR* precedent in two respects. We respectfully disagree with the changes they propose and how they apply the law in this case.

First, we disagree with our colleagues’ view that the first element of the *CPR* test — which requires “an acquisition of a beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it” — should be replaced with the much broader notion of an “advantage”, whether or not “a proprietary interest was actually acquired by the government” (see paras. 4, 25, 27, 38, 40 and 44-45). Our colleagues’ reformulation involves an unwarranted departure from *CPR* and significantly expands the potential liability of public authorities when regulating land use in the public interest. In our view, this Court should retain the *CPR* test for a *de facto* taking, which insists that a proprietary interest be acquired. Courts across common law Canada have applied this test without difficulty.

Second, we disagree with our colleagues’ view that a public authority’s “intention” is a material fact in a claim for a *de facto* taking (para. 53). This is also an unwarranted departure from *CPR* and this Court’s prior jurisprudence. The material facts for a *de facto* taking claim concern the *effects* of the public authority’s regulatory activity, not its *intention*.

Here, Annapolis’ *de facto* taking claim arises from Halifax’s refusal to “up-zone” (in French: “*procéder à un rezonage pour usage plus intensif*”) land — to re-zone to enlarge the permissible uses of land, in this case so that Annapolis may commercially develop the land for housing — in connection with about 1,000 acres of vacant and treed land owned by Annapolis (”Annapolis Lands”). Annapolis’ proposed use for commercial development is impermissible and has been impermissible for many years. Annapolis now alleges that a Halifax municipal council resolution in 2016 refusing to up-zone the land to permit development — a regular occurrence in municipalities across Canada — and Halifax’s alleged acts of trespass in encouraging the public to hike, canoe, and swim on the lands, give rise to claims for *de facto* taking, abuse of public office, and unjust enrichment.

> [...]

Annapolis’ core claim is that Halifax’s refusal to up-zone its land to permit residential development, along with the fact that Halifax acted deliberately to secure the advantage of using the Annapolis Lands as a public park, constitutes a *de facto* taking. However, a refusal to up-zone, in the circumstances of this case, cannot establish a *de facto* taking unless this Court departs from the common law requirements that Halifax has acquired a beneficial interest involving the property and that Halifax has removed all reasonable uses of the property. We decline to alter the settled law to allow Annapolis to proceed with its claim. We are respectfully of the view that by acceding to Annapolis’ plea to set aside this Court’s decision in *CPR* as a governing precedent, our colleagues’ opinion risks radically changing the complexion of municipal planning law by providing, in like up-zoning contexts, a windfall to developers who speculate at municipal taxpayers’ expense.

#### II. Background

We take no issue with our colleagues’ summary of the factual background and the decisions below, but we wish to highlight the precise conduct of Halifax that Annapolis alleges constitutes a *de facto* taking: (1) refusing to up-zone the Annapolis Lands and to zone the lands as a park, and (2) encouraging the public to trespass.

Between the 1950s and 2014, Annapolis, a real estate development company, acquired the Annapolis Lands, consisting of about 1,000 acres of vacant and treed land. Annapolis hoped to develop the lands into residential communities and to sell the development for a profit. The Annapolis Lands — which are still vacant and treed — are next to the Blue Mountain-Birch Cove Lakes Wilderness Area, a large wilderness area protected under the Wilderness Areas Protection Act, S.N.S. 1998, c. 27.

In 2006, Halifax adopted a “Regional Municipal Planning Strategy” as a policy statement to guide land development in the municipality. This policy, essentially a vision statement of long-term property development in the municipality, was adopted under the Municipal Government Act, S.N.S. 1998, c. 18, and the Halifax Regional Municipality Charter, S.N.S. 2008, c. 39 (”Halifax Charter”). Both statutes require Halifax to put in place a municipal planning strategy containing “statements of policy” to “guide the development and management of the municipality”, including “the future use, management and development of lands within the municipality” (Municipal Government Act, ss. 212 to 214; Halifax Charter, ss. 227 to 229). Both statutes also expressly provide that “[t]he adoption of a municipal planning strategy does *not* commit the council to undertake any of the projects suggested in it” (Municipal Government Act, s. 217(2); Halifax Charter, s. 232(2) (emphasis added to both statutes)).

Under Halifax’s 2006 Regional Municipal Planning Strategy, about a third of the Annapolis Lands are designated “Urban Settlement”, which means they could be developed for serviced residential communities within 25 years. The remaining two-thirds of the Annapolis Lands are designated “Urban Reserve”, which means they could be developed after 25 years. Serviced development on the Annapolis Lands cannot occur, however, unless Halifax adopts a municipal resolution authorizing a “secondary planning process” and amends its zoning by-law to allow residential development.

Starting in 2007, Annapolis urged Halifax to take these legislative measures to permit Annapolis to build residential communities on the lands. Halifax has consistently refused to do so, preferring to maintain the *status quo*. In 2016, Halifax adopted a municipal resolution stating that it would not authorize a secondary planning process on the Annapolis Lands “at this time”.

The 2016 municipal resolution refusing to up-zone the lands to permit development led to this litigation. In 2017, Annapolis sued Halifax for over $120 million for the alleged *de facto* taking of its lands and for abuse of public office and unjust enrichment.

Only the *de facto* taking claim is in issue on this appeal. Annapolis alleges that Halifax refused to up-zone the lands because it intends to use them for a park and that Halifax has encouraged the public to trespass on the lands to hike, canoe, and swim. Annapolis also claims that Halifax has refused to zone the lands as a park because it would otherwise have a statutory obligation to buy the lands within a year (see Municipal Government Act, s. 222; Halifax Charter, s. 237). Annapolis’ key allegations of *de facto* taking are set out in its amended statement of claim, dated March 22, 2017, at paras. 111-12:

> [Halifax] has *de facto* expropriated the Annapolis Lands for public use as a park. [Halifax] has delayed and obstructed all of Annapolis’ attempts to develop the Annapolis Lands, and likewise, has deliberately avoided expressly zoning the Annapolis Lands to avoid its compensation obligation. In doing so, it has obtained the use of the Annapolis Lands as a public park, and has deprived Annapolis of any use of the Annapolis Lands.

> Indeed, [Halifax] encourages members of the public to use the Annapolis Lands as a park. In addition to a variety of other outdoor activities, members of the public hike, cycle, canoe, camp, and swim on the Annapolis Lands as if [Halifax] held the Annapolis Lands as a park.

> (A.R., vol. I, at p. 146)

As we will explain, none of these pleaded acts, alone or in combination, amount to a *de facto* taking.

> [...]

Our colleagues’ reformulation of the acquisition requirement and departure from *CPR* as precedent has significant ramifications. It dramatically expands the potential liability of municipalities engaged in land use regulation in the public interest and throws into question the settled law that a refusal to up-zone is not a *de facto* taking.

For example, in *Tener*, at pp. 557 and 564, Estey J. affirmed that “[o]rdinarily, in this country, ... compensation does not follow zoning either up or down.... The imposition of zoning regulation and the regulation of activities on lands ... add nothing to the value of public property.”

Similarly, in *Mariner*, at pp. 713 and 734, Cromwell J.A. stated that “[i]t is settled law ... that the regulation of land use which has the effect of decreasing the value of the land is not an expropriation.... [O]rdinarily compensation does not follow zoning either up or down.... Development freezes have consistently been held not to give rise to rights of compensation”.

This settled law, which our colleagues propose now to set aside, was helpfully summarized by E. C. E. Todd in *The Law of Expropriation and Compensation in Canada* (2nd ed. 1992), at pp. 22-23:

> By the imposition, removal or alteration of land use controls a public authority may dramatically increase, or decrease, the value of land by changing the permitted uses which may be made of it. In such a case, in the absence of express statutory provision to the contrary an owner is not entitled to compensation or any other remedy notwithstanding that subdivision approval or rezoning is refused or development is blocked or frozen pursuant to statutory planning powers in order, for example, to facilitate the future acquisition of the land for public purposes. [Footnotes omitted.]

See also S. E. Hamill, “Common Law Property Theory and Jurisprudence in Canada” (2015), 40 Queen’s L.J. 679, at p. 703 (”So long as the owner can continue to use their property as they always have, they cannot be considered to have suffered a legally recognizable loss”); S. M. Makuch, N. Craik and S. B. Leisk, *Canadian Municipal and Planning Law* (2nd ed. 2004), at p. 212 (”the courts would be well advised to remain true to their traditional approach, which is in keeping with the general assumptions of no compensation for planning decisions and of allowing municipalities to allocate the benefits and burdens of planning”).

> [...]

#### IV. Application

> [...]

Neither Halifax’s 2016 municipal resolution refusing to up-zone the Annapolis Lands nor Halifax’s alleged acts of encouraging the public to trespass raises any genuine issue of material fact that Halifax has acquired a beneficial interest in the lands or flowing from them.

The municipal resolution merely preserved the *status quo* by refusing to allow lands which have always been vacant and treed and situated next to a protected wilderness area to be developed into serviced residential communities. It is of no moment that the 2006 Regional Municipal Planning Strategy, as a statement of policy, stated that a possible future use of the Annapolis Lands included serviced residential development. Both the *Municipal Government Act* and the *Halifax Charter* confirm that “[t]he adoption of a municipal planning strategy does not commit the council to undertake any of the projects suggested in it” (Municipal Government Act, s. 217(2); Halifax Charter, s. 232(2)).

Halifax’s adoption of a municipal resolution refusing to up-zone the lands also cannot be a basis for a *de facto* taking claim because the resolution did not result in Halifax acquiring any proprietary interest in the lands. As this Court held in *CPR*, at para. 33, a mere assurance that land will be used or developed in accordance with a municipality’s vision, without precluding historical or current uses of the land, is “not the sort of benefit” that can meet the acquisition requirement. This is why the common law has consistently held that a refusal to up-zone is not actionable as a *de facto* taking. Our colleagues claim, at para. 64, that “[p]reserving a park in its natural state may constitute an advantage accruing to the state”, but this flouts *CPR*’s insistence that the public authority must have acquired a proprietary interest. A mere “advantage” does not suffice. Respectfully, our colleagues’ expansive approach to what constitutes a *de facto* taking departs from precedent and would result in *CPR* being decided differently.

We also respectfully disagree with our colleagues’ suggestion, at para. 65, that Halifax’s alleged encouragement of trespass changes this conclusion. For example, at the hearing of the appeal, Annapolis insisted that Halifax has distributed promotional material encouraging people to hike at Fox Lake, which is within the Annapolis Lands. Annapolis claimed that this was an example of Halifax’s “use [of] the Annapolis Lands as a Regional Park” (outline of argument, at para. 5, in condensed book, at p. 2). We disagree. A public authority does not and cannot acquire a proprietary interest by encouraging others to trespass. If these allegations were made out at trial, Halifax might well expose itself to liability on some other basis. But this allegation cannot ground a claim for a *de facto* taking.

Even if Annapolis could establish that Halifax has acquired a beneficial interest in the Annapolis Lands or flowing from them, it cannot meet the second requirement of the test for a *de facto* taking: there is no genuine issue of material fact that Halifax has deprived Annapolis of all reasonable uses of its lands. This in itself is fatal to Annapolis’ appeal given that the two requirements in *CPR* are cumulative.

This second element of the *CPR* test must be assessed “not only in relation to the land’s potential highest and best use, but having regard to the nature of the land and the range of reasonable uses to which it has actually been put” (*CPR*, at para. 34, quoting *Mariner*, at p. 717). When “a regulatory regime is imposed on land, its *actual application* in the specific case must be examined, *not* the potential, but as yet unexploited, range of possible regulation” (*Mariner*, at p. 718 (underlining added)). Confinement to uneconomic uses is insufficient (*CPR*, at paras. 8 and 27-31). Loss of virtually all economic value is also insufficient (*Mariner*, at pp. 714 and 719-27).

In *CPR*, for example, this Court held that the City of Vancouver’s by-law did not remove all reasonable uses of the property because it did not prevent the landowner from using its land to operate a railway, the only use to which the land had ever been put during the history of the City (para. 34).

The situation here is indistinguishable. As the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal noted, at para. 14, “[t]he zoning of the Annapolis Lands has not changed since the adoption of the Land Use By-law in 2006.” The court added: “Annapolis has the same rights with respect to its lands that it had prior to Council’s resolution on September 6, 2016. Nothing has changed” (para. 91). The lands were vacant and treed when Annapolis acquired them, and they remain vacant and treed. Halifax’s refusal to up-zone the lands in 2016 did not deprive Annapolis of any reasonable uses of its lands. It simply disappointed Annapolis’ hope of developing them. Annapolis speculated that, one day, it would have that right. The company made a bet and lost. There is no principled basis for saying that Halifax and its taxpayers now have to guarantee that speculative bet. We therefore agree with the submission of Halifax’s counsel, that “[Annapolis] bought barren land with no rights to do anything more than that. The municipality is not the guarantor of their land speculation” (transcript, at p. 79).

Contrary to our colleagues’ suggestion at para. 72, Halifax has not taken Annapolis’ “right” to develop the lands. Annapolis claims that it had an unfettered right to develop the lands before they were first zoned in 1982. Yet Annapolis grounds its *de facto* taking claim in the proceedings before us in Halifax’s refusal to up-zone *in 2016* — which, as already noted, did not affect the zoning of the lands or Annapolis’ rights. Indeed, our colleagues acknowledge that *the zoning has not changed since 2006* (para. 7). The potential permissible uses of the lands before 1982 are thus irrelevant to Annapolis’ claim.

We therefore agree with the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, at para. 92: “... the lands and the reasonable uses to which Annapolis can put them remain exactly as they have been for many years”. This responds to our colleagues’ criticism that the Court of Appeal “failed to identify a single reasonable possible use of the property” (para. 70; see also para. 74). The lands remain vacant and treed and are zoned exactly as before. Further, as counsel for Halifax conceded during oral argument, subject to the current zoning Annapolis can lease the lands (transcript, at p. 72), just as CPR could in *CPR* (*CPR*, at para. 34). We note, too, that confinement of the land to uneconomic uses does not in itself establish a *de facto* taking (see *CPR*, at paras. 8 and 34; Horsman and Morley, at § 5:13).

In our respectful view, there is no basis in the record for our colleagues to assert that “it is disputed whether Halifax, by allegedly treating the Annapolis Lands as a public park, has *eliminated* all uses of the Lands except serviced development, which is conditional upon the approval of Annapolis’ secondary planning applications” (para. 69 (emphasis added)). Halifax did not eliminate or remove any reasonable use of the property. It simply refused to up-zone the lands to allow for residential development.

Our colleagues nevertheless claim, at para. 76, that “it is telling that [Kasirer and Jamal JJ.] do not identify *any* reasonable use of the Annapolis Lands” (emphasis in original). Respectfully, this illustrates how our colleagues have changed the law. First, our colleagues evaluate the reasonable uses of the lands from the perspective of a commercial property developer, even though our law has never required that the “use” be confined to those of one class of landowner. Second, the removal requirement insists not merely that there be no reasonable uses, but also that they have been *removed by the public authority*. The issue is whether there has been a *de facto* taking *by the public authority*. Annapolis cannot show that Halifax removed any reasonable uses. Nor, in any event, is there any legal impediment to Annapolis leasing the lands.

Our colleagues respond to the zoning and uses of the Annapolis Lands having not changed with the suggestion that this ignores “Halifax’s *application* of the regulatory scheme as alleged by Annapolis” (para. 71 (emphasis in original)). Our colleagues assert that “[i]f Annapolis can prove at trial that Halifax is unlikely to *ever* grant secondary planning approval, this is clearly material to its constructive taking claim” (para. 72 (emphasis in original)). We respectfully disagree. As a matter of proof, we do not see how Annapolis can prove a negative, particularly one involving a future fact.

More importantly, even if Annapolis could somehow show that Halifax will never up-zone the lands, that could not establish that Annapolis has lost all reasonable uses of those lands. The lands have never been used for serviced development — they have always been vacant and treed. Our colleagues’ assertion amounts to saying that a refusal to up-zone vacant land can give rise to a *de facto* taking merely if all “*potential* reasonable uses” are prohibited (para. 45 (emphasis in original)). That would upset the settled law reflected in *Manitoba Fisheries* , *Tener* , *Mariner* , and *CPR*, and it would eliminate Halifax’s statutory and common law protection from liability for refusing to up-zone. In *CPR*, this Court specifically noted that removal of all reasonable uses of the land must be assessed in relation to both its potential uses as well as the “nature of the land and the range of reasonable uses to which it has actually been put” (para. 34, quoting *Mariner*, at p. 717). That statement applies equally in this case.

##### C. Conclusion

We conclude that there is no genuine issue of material fact that Halifax has acquired a beneficial interest in the Annapolis Lands or flowing from them or that Halifax has deprived Annapolis of all reasonable uses of its lands. In view of the settled law, the pleading of a *de facto* taking has no real chance of success. Like the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, we would grant partial summary judgment dismissing the claim for *de facto* taking.

#### V. Disposition

We would dismiss the appeal with costs throughout.

*Appeal allowed.*

## Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement

[{{< figure src="/media/cusma.jpg" caption="Source: Shealah Craighead - Wikimedia Commons" >}}](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:President_Donald_J._Trump_at_the_G20_Summit_(44300765490).jpg) 

**One more wrinkle:** While *Mariner* and *Annapolis*, above, involved Canadian landowners, the situation may well have been different if, for example, the land in either case had been owned by an American or Mexican investor. 

- International trade law--and the growing thicket of bilateral and multilateral trade agreements that dominate in this area--may determine landowners' rights to claim compensation for regulatory takings in foreign jurisdictions.

Article 14.8 and the associated Annex of the *Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement* (which recently replaced NAFTA as the main multilaterial agreement governing trade in North America) sets out the compensatory rights of foreign investor/owners. 

- Based on these provisions, do you think the landowner in *Annapolis* would have had a better or worse chance of getting compensation if it was an American development company? 

#### Article 14.8: Expropriation and Compensation

> 1 No Party shall expropriate or nationalize a covered investment either directly or indirectly through measures equivalent to expropriation or nationalization (expropriation), except:
>
>> (a) for a public purpose;
>>
>> (b) in a non-discriminatory manner;
>>
>> (c) on payment of prompt, adequate, and effective compensation in accordance with paragraphs 2, 3, and 4; and
>>
>> (d) in accordance with due process of law.

#### Annex 14-6 Expropriation

The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:

> 1 An action or a series of actions by a Party cannot constitute an expropriation unless it interferes with a tangible or intangible property right or property interest in an investment.
> 
> 2 Article 14.8.1 (Expropriation and Compensation) addresses two situations. The first is direct expropriation, in which an investment is nationalized or otherwise directly expropriated through formal transfer of title or outright seizure.
> 
> 3 The second situation addressed by Article 14.8.1 (Expropriation and Compensation) is indirect expropriation, in which an action or series of actions by a Party has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure.
>
>> (a) The determination of whether an action or series of actions by a Party, in a specific fact situation, constitutes an indirect expropriation, requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors:
>>
>>> (i) the economic impact of the government action, although the fact that an action or series of actions by a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred,
>>>
>>> (ii) the extent to which the government action interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations,19 and
>>>
>>> (iii) the character of the government action, including its object, context, and intent.
>>
>> (b) Non-discriminatory regulatory actions by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as health, safety and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriations, except in rare circumstances.
