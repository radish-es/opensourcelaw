We will take a pause this week to revisit, review and synthesize the material we've covered so far in Unit 3. The goal is to help you gain a firmer grasp on the core themes, doctrines and applications from this unit as you head into reading week and perhaps start to plan your studying for final exams. 

To prepare you for class this week, I have drafted a number of targeted review questions that emphasize key concepts and issues we have studied in Unit 3. Please work through these questions and bring your answers—along with your own questions about the material—to class for discussions. There are no additional readings for you to complete this week. 

## Review Questions

The following is a list of "rapid review" questions. I don't suggest that you address them all in full detail. Instead, aim to briefly consider and then attempt to answer each question in around 5 minutes (per question) to gain a broad review of the material. The primary purpose of these questions is to provide a check on your knowledge and understanding of the Unit 3 materials so far and to help you identify areas for more intensive review. 

### [Week 11 - Land Use Control I (Expropriation)](../week11/)

- How does the Canadian Supreme Court in *McLaren v Caldwell* differ from the U.S. Supreme Court in *Pennsylvania Coal Co v Mahon* in characterizing the issue of *de facto* expropriation?

- What is the legal test for *de facto* expropriation in Canadian law? 

- Why is the concept of "reasonable use of the land" important for determining if a *de facto* expropriation has taken place? How do we know what the "reasonable use of land" is? 

- Was an interest in land acquired by government in our case study of Blue Mountain-Birch Cove Lakes? If not, can you give an example of government action that would amount to the acquisition of an interest in land (short of outright expropriation of title)? 

- Is the loss or gain of land value irrelevant to the analysis of *de facto* expropriation? Why or why not?

### [Week 12 - Land Use Control II (Acquired Rights)](../week12/)

- What is the relationship between the growing use of planning and zoning regimes by municipal authorities and the acquired rights established by common law courts? 

- If the operation of a bicycle repair shop was permitted on land last year, but the zoning was changed to exclude bicycle repair shops last month, does the landowner retain the right to operate a garage on their land?

- What is the legal test for determining the scope of an acquired right? 

- If the owner of land has an acquired right to operate a bicycle repair shop, can they open a garage to repair cars on that same land? What about a busy gas station? 

- How is the "police power" discussed in *Mahon* related to the city's power to regulate "harmonious development and welfare" in *Saint-Romuald v Olivier*?

### [Week 13 - Right to Shelter](../week13/)

- There are 175 available shelter beds in a city; according to the local government's best estimate, there are no more than 150 homeless persons living in the city. Do those experiencing homelessness have a right to shelter in public parks? On city sports fields or on the city's busy waterfront boardwalk? 

- What would it mean to have a right to *adequate* shelter? How, if at all, is "adequacy" related to the choices or preferences of those in need of shelter?

- In what way is a time-limited right to shelter in public parks between 7PM and 9AM similar to or different from a municipal bylaw prohibiting "panhandling" in some downtown areas but permitting it in others? 

### [Week 14 - Restrictive Covenants](../week14/)

- Are restrictive covenants contracts or incidents of property? 

- On what legal basis can a restrictive covenant be enforced against a subsequent owner of the servient lands (i.e., "run with the land")? 

- What legal requirements does a restrictive covenant need to meet in order to be considered valid on its terms? 

- Is a restrictive covenant requiring that agricultural crops grown on the land be cultivated organically one that is negative in nature? What about a covenant requiring upkeep on a fence line? 

- Would a restrictive covenant prohibiting sale of agricultural land to certain named corporations "touch and concern" the land? Would it be otherwise enforceable? 

- What are the legal requirements that must be met in order for a court to apply the public policy doctrine to invalidate a restrictive covenant?

### [Week 15 - Qualified Interests](../week15/)

- In what sense are possessory and future interests both "present interests"? 

- Classify the property interests created in the following devise in trust: "to A for life, then to B for life, then to C if they graduate high school."

- Can the public policy doctrine ever apply to a private bequest? 

- What is the legal relevance of the recitals contained in the trust document in *Canada Trust Co v Ontario*? 

- Why is it significant that the bequest in *McCorkill* is vested rather than contingent?

### Thematic Review: Modern Style of Common Law Thought

After you have completed the rapid review questions above, aim to spend some time considering the broader thematic question below.

**Give one or more examples of each of the following judicial moves from the materials in Unit 3:**

- The individual freedoms of property owners and free competition between those interests recedes to the background; public power and demands for social control are drawn into the foreground.

- The relevance of legal distinctions between private and public interests  is explicitly or implicitly contested (or rejected entirely).

- Social consequences of the decision become a primary consideration; formalist reliance on settled principles is diminished.
